<blockquote><p>[...] The Office and Management and Budget (OMB) released a memo: "Moving the U.S. Government Towards Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles". The memo is a reaction to 2020's SolarWinds incident and 2021's Colonial Pipeline rasomware attack, and advises the Federal Government on what steps each agency must take to improve its cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Many of the items in the memo go well-beyond even what the top enterprises and tech startups are doing today. It looks like the government is planning to position itself as a cybersecurity leader (rather than a laggard), while also pushing the private sector into a more robust cybersecurity posture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good recommendations all-around.</p>
