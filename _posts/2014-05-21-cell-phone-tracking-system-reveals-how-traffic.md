"What they found, perhaps surprisingly, is that during rush hour, 98 percent of roads in the Boston area were in fact below traffic capacity, while just 2 percent of roads had more cars on them than they could handle," the Globe wrote. "The backups on these roads ripple outward, causing traffic to snarl across the Hub."</blockquote>
