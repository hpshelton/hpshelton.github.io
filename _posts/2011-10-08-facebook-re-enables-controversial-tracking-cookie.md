<p>Kinda sorta. From a Facebook engineer in <a href="http://nikcub.appspot.com/facebook-re-enables-controversial-tracking-cookie#comment-326368718">the comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>We have been made aware of 2 instances in the past 2 weeks related to cookies which needed to be addressed.  What you describe in this post is not a re-enabling of anything, but a separate issue involving a limited number of sites, including CBSSports.</blockquote>
<p>It's starting to sound like either Facebook doesn't know where their cookies go and how they'e used, or their whole cookie management system is riddled with bugs. Both ignorance and incompetence are confidence-inspiring.</p>
