I love cognitive psychology:

<blockquote>Researchers previously thought that different processes in the brain were subject to separate bottlenecks. For example, the process of reading a map might be limited by a very different mechanism than the act of evaluating ideas and forming opinions. However, new research in <i>PNAS</i> suggests that a "unified" bottleneck may restrict our ability to perform very different cognitive processes simultaneously.</blockquote>
