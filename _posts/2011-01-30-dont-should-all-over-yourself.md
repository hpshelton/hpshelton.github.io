<blockquote>Being a man means taking control of your life and being responsible for yourself. <b>A man does as he chooses, while a boy does as he should</b>. However, some men never make this leap; they struggle with carving out their own path in life.<br>
<br>
So they flounder. Because they've never actually figured out what they really want in life, they end up picking life goals they think they should have simply because everyone around them–/society/television/family/religion–tells them they should have those goals. In short, they <i>should</i> on themselves.</blockquote>
