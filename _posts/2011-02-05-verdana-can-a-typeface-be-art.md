<blockquote>Ask most computer users what they think of the Verdana font and you'll typically get a "meh" type response. The big daddy of fonts (or typefaces) is Helvetica – much loved by designers and until last week, it was the only typeface in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Until now.</blockquote>
