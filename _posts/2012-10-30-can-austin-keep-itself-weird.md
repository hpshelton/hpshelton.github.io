<blockquote>In November, Austin will become the American home of Grand Prix Formula One racing: Big-name sponsors, racecars going 180 miles an hour, $4,300 tickets to V.I.P. seating, Champagne and helicopters flying wealthy fans from locations all over the city to the new $450 million race facility built by a bond trader and a billionaire. For three days, the global elite who follow Grand Prix racing will touch down in Austin from Abu Dhabi before taking off again three days later for SÃ£o Paulo or Monaco. It seems a strange departure, frankly, for a city whose reputation was built on sunshine, tacos, good coffee and better margaritas, Willie Nelson, Longhorn football and barbecue.</blockquote>
