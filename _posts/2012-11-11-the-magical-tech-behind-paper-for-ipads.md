<blockquote>In the new version of Paper released last week, you mix colors with your fingers, like it's paint--only somehow more beautiful. This one magical feature burned a year of development time, resurrected the work of two dead German scientists, and got Apple's attention.</blockquote>
<p>The only problem with describing the wonderful development process for this new user-interaction is that you can't actually interact with the end result to see how well it works.</p>
