<blockquote><p>This is fascinating. Original NASA transcripts from early space exploration. The <a href="http://apollo13.spacelog.org/page/-00:00:00:20/">transcript formatting</a> reads like blog comments or a Twitter conversation. Every comment has a permanent URI &#8212; here&#8217;s the original &#8220;<a href="http://apollo13.spacelog.org/02:07:55:35/#show-selection">Houston, we&#8217;ve had a problem</a>.&#8221; Additional controls at the bottom of each page reveal the original transcript and a map showing where the crew was during the conversation.</p>

<p>If this isn&#8217;t making content meaningful, accessible (in a traditional sense), and enjoyable to consume, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p></blockquote>

Plus, for all you technical types, you can get involved with the actual transcription and site integration at their <a href="null">GitHub page</a>.
