Funny that they want to celebrate Christmas while their "about" page condemns altruism:
<blockquote>
Altruism = selflessness, self-flagellation, pity, sacrifice, brotherly love, shame, societal obligation, undeserved guilt</blockquote>
It would seem pretty hard to celebrate Christmas without the Christmas tree, wreaths, colors, or "societal obligations" to give gifts.
