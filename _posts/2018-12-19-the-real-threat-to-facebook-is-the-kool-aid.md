<blockquote>But the leaks are not the disease, just the symptom. Sunken morale is the cause, and it's dragging down the company.</blockquote>
<blockquote>How to stop morale's downward momentum will be one of Facebook's greatest tests of leadership. This isn't a bug to be squashed. It can't just roll back a feature update. And an apology won't suffice. It will have to expel or reeducate the leakers and those disloyal without instilling a witch hunt's sense of dread. Compensation may have to jump upwards to keep talent aboard like Twitter did when it was floundering. Its top brass will need to show candor and accountability without fueling more indiscretion. And it may need to make a shocking, landmark act of contrition to convince employees it's capable of change.</blockquote>
