<blockquote>US law (in fact, Maryland state law) has been imposed on a .com domain operating outside the USA, which is the subtext we were very worried about when we commented on SOPA. Even though SOPA is currently in limbo, the reality appears to be that US law can now be asserted over all domains registered under .com, .net, org, .biz and maybe .info.</blockquote>
