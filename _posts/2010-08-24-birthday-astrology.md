My great-aunt sent me a link to a website that tells you all sorts of trivial details about your birthday. The results in the astrology section were particularly interesting, so in honor of my birthday, I thought I'd put them up. 

<h3>Numerology</h3>

My "life path number" is 3:

<blockquote>The Life Path 3 indicates that you entered this plane with a strong sense of creativity and with wonderful communication skills.</blockquote>

Ha. It gets worse from there:

<blockquote>You are not very good at handling money because of a general lack of concern about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The 3 loves connecting with people. Accordingly, the life path 3 produces individuals who are always a welcome addition to any social situation and know how to make others feel at home. Your disposition is almost surely sunny and openhearted.</blockquote>

Or almost surely not. Teehehe.

<blockquote>When hurt, you can easily retreat to a shell of morose silence for extended periods.</blockquote>

Okay, getting better...

<blockquote>Because of your own sensitivity to hurt, you have a caring disposition and seem to be very conscious of other people's feelings and emotions.</blockquote>

Um. Maybe?

<blockquote>Guard against being critical of others, impatient, intolerant, or overly optimistic.</blockquote>

Yes, yes, yes, and what?

<h3>Astrological Sign</h3>

My Astrological sign is Virgo, but I am born "on the cusp", so we also get to take qualities Leos.

<h4>Virgo</h4>

<blockquote>Virgos are usually observant, shrewd, critically inclined, judicious, patient, practical supporters of the status quo, and tend toward conservatism in all departments of life. On the surface they are emotionally cold.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But the outward lack of feeling may, in some individuals born under this sign, conceal too much emotion, to which they are afraid of giving way because they do not trust others, or because they do not have confidence in themselves and their judgments.</blockquote>

Pretty good off the bat.

<blockquote>Yet in their unassuming, outwardly cheerful and agreeable fashion, they can be sensible, discreet, well spoken, wise and witty, with a good understanding of other people's problems which they can tackle with a practicality not always evident in their own personal relationships.</blockquote>

I don't think I fit the first part of that sentence, but I agree with the second and third. Although I'm not really sure what the last phrase is implying.

<blockquote>They are intellectually inquiring, methodical and logical, studious and teachable. They combine mental ingenuity with the ability to produce a clear analysis of the most complicated problems. They have an excellent eye for detail but they may be so meticulous that they neglect larger issues. Also, although they are realists, they may slow down projects by being too exact. Thoroughness, hard work and conscientiousness are their hallmarks, and they are such perfectionists that, if things go wrong, they are easily discouraged. Because of their ability to see every angle of a many-sided question, they are unhappy with abstract theorizing. Appreciating the many different points of view as they do, they find philosophical concepts difficult, and they vacillate and have no confidence in any conclusions at which they arrive.</blockquote>

Beautiful. The last sentence is tempered by the qualities of Leo, discussed below.

<blockquote>With these qualities, they are better as subordinates than leaders. Responsibility irks them and they often lack the breadth of strategic vision that a leader needs. Virgos are essentially tacticians, admirable in the attainment of limited objectives. Their self distrust is something they project on to other people and tends to make them exacting employers, though in the demands they make on those under them they temper this attitude with justice.</blockquote>

Again, tempered by the leadership skills of the Leo, but generally correct. They then go on to completely miss my career field:

<blockquote>They have potential abilities in the arts, sciences and languages. They may also find success as welfare workers, doctors, nurses, psychologists, teachers, confidential secretaries, inspectors, musicians, critics, public speakers and writers especially of reference works such as dictionaries and encyclopedias. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Their minds are such that they need the stimulus of practical problems to be solved rather than the mere routine or working to set specifications that need no thought. They are careful with money and their interest in statistics makes them excellent bookkeepers and accountants. They also make good editors, physicists and analytical chemists.</blockquote>

But they end on a generally good note.

<h4>Leo</h4>

<blockquote>They are ambitious, courageous, dominant, strong willed, positive, independent, self-confident, and self-controlled. They are born leaders, either in support of, or in revolt against, the status quo.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On the whole, they are powers for good, for they are strongly idealistic, humane, and beneficent. They have powerful intelligence and are of a broad philosophical, sometimes religious, turn of mind.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In his or her relations with others, the Leo type is open, sincere, genuine and trusting. Outgoing, spontaneously warm hearted, and plain spoken, though never lacking in kindliness, Leos are more disillusioned than the average if let down by those they trust. They are not good judges of character and are inclined to favoritism and an exaggerated faith in their followers which too often ends in disappointment.</blockquote>

Everything except the last sentence. And all the vices they list when we're not self-controlled.

<h3>Chinese Astrology</h3>

In Chinese astrology, I am a Earth Dragon.

<h4>Dragon</h4>

Dragons are "honest, sensitive, brave, and self-assured."

<blockquote>Dragons must be free and uninhibited. The Dragon is a beautiful creature, colorful and flamboyant. An extroverted bundle of energy, gifted and utterly irrepressible, everything Dragons do is on a grand scale - big ideas, ornate gestures, extreme ambitions.</blockquote>

Um. Maybe? Probably not?

<h4>Earth</h4>

<blockquote>Earth is associated with the qualities of patience, thoughtfulness, practicality, hard work, and stability. The earth element is also nurturing and seeks to draw all things together with itself, in order to bring harmony, rootedness and stability. Other attributes of the earth element include ambition, stubbornness, responsibility and long-term planning. In pathology, the earth can represent selfishness and self-centeredness. Earth's negative emotion is anxiety and its positive emotion is empathy. </blockquote>

Pretty much dead on.

<h4>Earth Dragon</h4>

<blockquote>Earth Dragons make great managers because they are practical, levelheaded and demonstrate a knack for organizing. They still have the need to dictate and be admired, but they are affable, congenial and supportive. The Earth element adds a greater portion of self-control to the Dragon's personality and usually the Earth Dragon is deserving of the respect he or she desires. These Dragons take their life and romantic responsibilities quite seriously.</blockquote>

Oh, good. I do have self-control and am committed to things. I was worried there for a second.

<h3>"Birth Tree"</h3>

My "birth tree" is the "Cedar of Confidence":

<blockquote>Of rare beauty, knows how to adapt, likes luxury, of good health, not in the least shy, tends to look down on others, self-confident, determined, impatient, wants to impress others, many talents, industrious, optimistic, waiting for the one true love, able to make quick decisions.</blockquote>

Wait. There are "birth trees"? 7/6/3 true/false/maybe. They just randomly picked 
attributes for this one.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

There are some wacky things in the world, with numerology apparently being one of them. But, the astrologers could probably get away with using me as a case study. Nothing here beats the Meyers-Briggs test, though; that actually taught me things about myself, rather than just confirming what I already knew.

So, here's to a year of using all my positive virtues, talents, and nature, defeating all my negative ones, gaining more maturity and wisdom, and living and loving more fully in the example of Christ.
