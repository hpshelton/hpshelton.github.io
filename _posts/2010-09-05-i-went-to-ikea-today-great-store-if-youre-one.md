I went to IKEA today. Great store, if you're one of the two people on the planet who's never been. Lots of cheap, easy to assemble, well-built Swedish furniture. Also lots of people. I hate crowds. Anyways, built myself a dresser, got some lamps, got this lightbulb in a lamp.

And I seriously have no idea what the math on the box is supposed to mean!

11 W !â‰ˆ 50 W ... unless the units don't mean the same thing.
10,000 h = 10 x 1,000 h ... always?

They should just stick to the pictorial instructions; math is not their strong suit.
