<blockquote>In the next issue of the journal <i>IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</i>, Gregory Wornell, a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, Uri Erez at Tel Aviv University in Israel, and Mitchell Trott at Google describe a new coding scheme that guarantees the fastest possible delivery of data over fluctuating wireless connections without requiring prior knowledge of noise levels.</blockquote>
<p>This is brilliant, and immediately implementable in the real-world to produce higher-quality and more efficient transmissions despite noise levels over the channel, such as WiFi or cell frequencies.</p>
