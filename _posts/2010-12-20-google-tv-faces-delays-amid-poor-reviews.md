<blockquote>The biggest promise of Internet television — the ability to watch any show or movie at any time, streamed over the Web — is far from reality with Google TV. People can pay to watch shows or movies on demand using Netflix or Amazon on Google TV, and can watch regular TV programming. The major networks, though, are not providing shows on Google TV, and NBC, CBS, ABC and Hulu have blocked people from watching full-length shows on their Web sites using Google TV.</blockquote>

And now Google is asking partners to delay introducing their versions.
