I don't agree with everything he's advocating, but this is a superbly written criticism of Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">criticism </a>of Adobe's Flash. Adobe's initial response is <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/04/29/live-blogging-the-journals-interview-with-adobe-ceo/">here</a>, and their better one is <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2010/04/moving_forward.html">here</a>. Microsoft also joined in on the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/30/microsoft-weighs-in-the-future-of-the-web-is-html5?icid=sphere_blogsmith_inpage_engadget">criticism</a>, repeating concerns over stability and security in Flash Player.
