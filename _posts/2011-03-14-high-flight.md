Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth<br>
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br>
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br>
of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things<br>
You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung<br>
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,<br>
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br>
My Spitfire through footless halls of air....<br>
<br>
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue<br>
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy skills<br>
Where never lark or even eagle flew —<br>
And, while with silent lifting mind I have trod<br>
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br>
- Put out my arm, and touched the face of God.<br>
