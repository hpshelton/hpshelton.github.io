<blockquote>If the evangelical Christian leadership thinks that "cool Christianity" is a sustainable path forward, they are severely mistaken. As a twentysomething, I can say with confidence that when it comes to church, we don't want cool as much as we want real.<br><br> If we are interested in Christianity in any sort of serious way, it is not because it's easy or trendy or popular. It's because Jesus himself is appealing, and what he says rings true. It's because the world we inhabit is utterly phony, ephemeral, narcissistic, image-obsessed and sex-drenchedâ€”and we want an alternative. It's not because we want more of the same.</blockquote> I might have to pick up Brett McCracken's book, "Hipster Christianity: Where Church and Cool Collide".
