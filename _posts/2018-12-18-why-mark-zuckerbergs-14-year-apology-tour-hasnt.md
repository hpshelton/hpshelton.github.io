<blockquote>As far as I can tell, not once in his apology tour was Zuckerberg asked what on earth he means when he refers to Facebook's 2 billion-plus users as "a community" or "the Facebook community." A community is a set of people with reciprocal rights, powers, and responsibilities.</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. It's the same reason I don't love startups who insist they're a family - I don't have the ability to leave my family and I wasn't born into your company. It's a false equivalence. The same is true of calling a mass-market surveillance platform a "community".</p>
