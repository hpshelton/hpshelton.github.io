<blockquote>I have spoken to many men and women who told me they were frequently "hit on" as they traveled and went out into public. Though some of them were exceptionally nice-looking and fashionably dressed, many were not. On the other hand, I have spoken to both men and women who were attractive by anyone's standard — even some who dressed more revealingly than I was comfortable with — but they were seldom "hit on" or ogled by others. Why? What was the difference? It wasn't their clothing; it was their souls. It has just as much (or more) to do with the person they wanted to present and their own struggles with lust as with what they wore.</blockquote>
Interesting perspective. More evidence for his position from 1 Peter 3:3-5 (NIV):
<blockquote>Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.</blockquote>
