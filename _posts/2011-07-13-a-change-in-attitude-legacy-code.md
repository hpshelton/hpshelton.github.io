I actually don't mind working on legacy code. Problem solving has always come naturally to me, I was trained to interpret illegible contest code in high school, and two of my previous jobs involved taking ownership of old software projects. It is definitely a fun and unique challenge every time. Trying to get my head around a decent portion of the Hotmail code base is proving more than a little daunting, however.
