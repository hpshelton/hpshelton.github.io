<blockquote><p>In early 2017, when she was an unknown law student, Ms. Khan published "<a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon's Antitrust Paradox</a>" in the Yale Law Journal. Her argument went against a consensus in antitrust circles that dates back to the 1970s â€” the moment when regulation was redefined to focus on consumer welfare, which is to say price. Since Amazon is renowned for its cut-rate deals, it would seem safe from federal intervention.</p>
<p>Ms. Khan disagreed. Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, she presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy.</p> 
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The paper got 146,255 hits, a runaway best-seller in the world of legal treatises. That popularity has rocked the antitrust establishment, and is making an unlikely celebrity of Ms. Khan in the corridors of Washington.</p>
