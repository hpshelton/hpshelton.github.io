<blockquote><p>In 2015, the call-blocking app YouMail estimated that close to a billion robo-calls were being placed every month. Two years later, that number has leapt to 2.5 billion. At best, these calls annoy. At worst, they defraud. By far, they constitute the top consumer complaint received by the FTC.</p>

There is a battle being waged over the inviolability of our telephone numbers â€” over the right to not be bothered.</p></blockquote>
