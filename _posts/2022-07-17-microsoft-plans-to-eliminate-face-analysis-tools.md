<blockquote><p>The technology giant will stop offering automated tools that predict a person's gender, age and emotional state and will restrict the use of its facial recognition tool.</p>
<p>Microsoft will also put new controls on its face recognition feature, which can be used to perform identity checks or search for a particular person. Uber, for example, uses the software in its app to verify that a driver's face matches the ID on file for that driver's account. Software developers who want to use Microsoft's facial recognition tool will need to apply for access and explain how they plan to deploy it.</p></blockquote>
