<blockquote><p>Ben Long, CreativePro.com:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Image editing&#8221; starts as soon as you lift your eye to the viewfinder. What you choose to include in the frame is a massive edit of the scene before you, and it&#8217;s important to understand just how powerful this &#8220;cropping&#8221; of the real world can be.</p>
