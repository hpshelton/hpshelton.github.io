<p>I went to the supermarket today so you don't have to. In liu of live-tweeting societal breakdown, here are some hopefully amusing vingettes.</p> 

<p>Cleaning wipes were available upon entering the store. They have not yet been stolen unlike the whole hand sanitizer dispenser stand at the Safeway down the street. I think they were actually moist dryer sheets, but the hospitality was still appreciated.</p> 

<p>All the bottled water was gone. No, bottled water is not needed.</p> 

<p>Everyone keeps asking me if I have enough toilet paper. I respond "How much is enough toilet paper?" Everyone laughs. No one answers. I may never ever know.</p>

<p>The groceries I buy regularly have a suspicious overlap with the list of recommended emergency non-perishables. It's unclear if my diet is just constantly in a state of emergency.</p> 

<p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">There is only one worthwhile brownie mix, Ghirardelli triple chocolate:</p>

Running low. Breaded pre-cut frozen chicken in cute dinosaur shapes? Running right into my tummy.</p> 

<p>What does it say about us when the only soups left on the shelf are Campbell's chicken noodle and all the Campbell's Chunky&trade;? What does it say about me that those are the only soups I buy?</p> 

<p>There are debates in the world that will likely never end. Coke vs Pepsi. Waffles vs pancakes. T-Rex vs Velociraptor. Prego vs Ragu is now definitively over. Even the mushroom-flavored Prego was gone.</p> 

<p>Oreos are not a panic buy. Not even the double-stuffed. I'm unclear why not.</p> 

<p>I was surprised the store-brand thin crust pizzas I like were sold out until I remembered I was at a different brand store.</p> 

<p>There's nothing like a disaster to make us re-evaluate our priorities and judge what's really important. Avocados.</p>  

<p>People will risk leaving the safety of their homes to scavange through a desert of groceries for milk and eggs in order to avoid just-add-water Bisquick pancakes.</p> 

<p>"Did you find everything you were looking for today?"</p> 

<p>My bank notified me of a suspicious transaction. I think it's because I spent money on groceries.</p>
