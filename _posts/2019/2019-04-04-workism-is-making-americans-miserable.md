<blockquote><p>Workism offers a perilous trade-off. On the one hand, Americans' high regard for hard work may be responsible for its special place in world history and its reputation as the global capital of start-up success. A culture that worships the pursuit of extreme success will likely produce some of it. But extreme success is a falsifiable god, which rejects the vast majority of its worshippers. Our jobs were never meant to shoulder the burdens of a faith, and they are buckling under the weight. A staggering 87 percent of employees are not engaged at their job, according to <a href="https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx">Gallup</a>. That number is rising by the year.</p>

<p>One solution to this epidemic of disengagement would be to make work less awful. But maybe the better prescription is to make work less <i>central</i>. </p></blockquote>
