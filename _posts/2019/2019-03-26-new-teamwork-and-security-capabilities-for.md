<blockquote><p>In February 2018, we launched Microsoft 365 Government to empower government agencies to collaborate and be productive while meeting their security and compliance requirements, including FedRamp, CJIS, IRS 1075, ITAR, DFAR, and NIST. As part of our continued investment to Microsoft 365 Government, today we're pleased to announce the availability of Microsoft Teams in all Microsoft 365 Government cloud environments.</p>
<p>While Teams has been available in the Government Community Cloud (GCC), today we are announcing the availability of Teams in GCC High and Department of Defense (DoD) environments. Teams is built to meet the enhanced security and compliance requirements of government agencies, which can now better deliver against their mission and provide services to citizens and constituents.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds like corporate-speak, but this is the culmination of two years of architectural changes and infrastructure work involving new identity management systems, security scanning solutions, network architectures and capabilities, and deployment technologies in partnership with eight teams in four divisions including Azure, Office, Skype, and Teams. There are some real heros involved in all the systems integration work, documentation, security and compliance reviews, and troubleshooting that went along with deploying 60+ Azure microservices in a locked-down environment.<p>
<p>We're pleased that U.S. government agencies at the local, tribal, state, and federal levels now have a modern, productive, and secure communications platform.</p>
<p>I'm extraordinarily proud to have been part of this effort and to hopefully have helped the government run a little more efficiently. On to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-announces-new-government-products-to-help-in-winning-deos-2019-3">DEOS</a>!</p>
