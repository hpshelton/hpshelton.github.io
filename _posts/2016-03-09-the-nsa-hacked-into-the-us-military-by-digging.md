<p><blockquote>On June 9, 1997, 25 officials of the National Security Agency — members of a security squad known as the "Red Team" — hacked into the computer networks of the Department of Defense, using only commercially available equipment and soft­ware. It was the first high-level exercise testing whether the U.S. military's leaders, facilities, and global combatant commands were prepared for a cyber attack. And the outcome was alarming.</blockquote></p>
