<blockquote>With each new generation of Windows Phone, Microsoft not only closes the gap with iOS and Android in important ways, but it also differentiates in important ways â€” and that might be more true in version 8 than ever before.</blockquote>
<p>There aren't a ton of compelling features (in my opinion) in this release due to the work necessary to port the software to a new kernel (though there are huge wins from that effort), but The Verge's review (and Ars Technica's) missed some of the cool tweaks that I haven't seen discussed publicly yet that will delight many people. Publicly announced features include Wallet and NFC, Kid's Corner, updated lock and home screen customizations, and new apps powered by the improved developer story such as Pandora, Cut the Rope, Temple Run, Words with Friends, and Draw Something. Did I mention massive hardware spec boosts?</p>
