<blockquote><p>This is the majority illusion â€” the local impression that a specific attribute is common when the global truth is entirely different.</p>
<p>The reason isn't hard to see. The majority illusion occurs when the most popular nodes are colored. Because these link to the greatest number of other nodes, they skew the view from the ground, as it were. That's why this illusion is so closely linked to the friendship paradox.</p></blockquote>
