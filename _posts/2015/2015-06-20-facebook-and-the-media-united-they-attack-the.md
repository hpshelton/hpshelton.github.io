<blockquote><p>Here's an absolute fact that all of these reporters, columnists, and media pundits need to get into their heads:</p>
<p>The web doesn't suck. Your websites suck.</p>
<p>All of your websites suck.</p>
<p>You destroy basic usability by hijacking the scrollbar. You take native functionality (scrolling, selection, links, loading) that is fast and efficient and you rewrite it with 'cutting edge' javascript toolkits and frameworks so that it is slow and buggy and broken. You balloon your websites with megabytes of cruft. You ignore best practices. You take something that works and is complementary to your business and turn it into a liability.</p>
<p>The lousy performance of your websites becomes a defensive moat around Facebook.</p></blockquote>
