<blockquote>A clever comic on the accuracy of George Orwell's predictions about future society over those of Aldous Huxley. It's informative and scary at the same time. "In short, Orwell feared that what we hate would ruin us. Huxley that what we love will ruin us." It's unfortunate that Huxley got it right because the latter is much less obvious.</blockquote>
