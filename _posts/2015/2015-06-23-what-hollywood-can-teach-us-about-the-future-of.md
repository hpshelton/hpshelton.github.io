<blockquote>This approach to business is sometimes called the "Hollywood model." A project is identified; a team is assembled; it works together for precisely as long as is needed to complete the task; then the team disbands. This short-足term, project-足based business structure is an alternative to the corporate model, in which capital is spent up front to build a business, which then hires workers for long-足term, open-足ended jobs that can last for years.</blockquote>
