<p><blockquote>The standard way of doing business in the social sciences ignores genetic influences, and has for years. Be careful which findings you cling to. Most social science research can only reveal associations; which is important, no doubt, but I presume you want to know something about causality also. To even begin approximating causality (assuming you cannot do an experiment, which you can't with most social science research), you must account for all confounding factors â€” genes included.</blockquote></p>
