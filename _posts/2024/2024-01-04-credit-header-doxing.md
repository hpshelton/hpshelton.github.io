<blockquote><p>[The credit header] is personal information that the credit bureaus Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion have on most adults in America via their credit cards. Through a complex web of agreements and purchases, that data trickles down from the credit bureaus to other companies who offer it to debt collectors, insurance companies, and law enforcement.</p>
<p>A 404 Media investigation has found that criminals have managed to tap into that data supply chain, in some cases by stealing former law enforcement officerâ€™s identities, and are selling unfettered access to their criminal cohorts online.</p></blockquote>
