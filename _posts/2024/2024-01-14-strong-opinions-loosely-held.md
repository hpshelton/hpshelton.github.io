<blockquote><p>The idea of strong opinions, loosely held is that you can make bombastic statements, and everyone should implicitly assume that you’ll happily change your mind in a heartbeat if new data suggests you are wrong. It is supposed to lead to a collegial, competitive environment in which ideas get a vigorous defense, the best of them survive, and no-one gets their feelings hurt in the process. </p>
<p>On a certain kind of team […] this can work well.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that ideal is seldom achieved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A great suggestion to make this culture work well is to temper your statement with a degree of uncertainty in order to make it safer to change your own mind and invite discussion.</p>
