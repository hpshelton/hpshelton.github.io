<blockquote>Unlike my typical blog entries, this blog is a very serious deep-dive into the C2PA provenance solution for photos, video, and other kinds of media. This solution is in the process of being adopted by hundreds of commercial organizations, from newsrooms and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/113/materials/slides-113-hrpc-harms-modelling-in-the-c2pa-witness-00">human rights observers</a> to camera manufacturers and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2023/10/27/content-credentials-that-label-ai-generated-images-are-coming-to-mobile-phones-and-cameras/">financial institutions</a>. I explicitly cover multiple security-related issues in the C2PA specification that enable a wide range of fraudulent activities, from the small-time catphishers and online merchant scammers to nation-state propaganda efforts and large-scale financial fraud. Consumers and corporations need to be aware: C2PA does not provide reliable and validated information about a photo's origins.</blockquote>
