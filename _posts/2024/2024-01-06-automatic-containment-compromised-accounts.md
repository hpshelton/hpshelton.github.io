<blockquote>Identifying and containing [...] compromised user accounts, therefore, prevents attacks from progressing, even if attackers gain initial access. This is why, <a href="https://aka.ms/ContainUserSecBlog">as announced today</a>, we added user containment to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender/automatic-attack-disruption">automatic attack disruption</a> capability in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, a unique and innovative defense mechanism that stops human-operated attacks in their tracks. User containment prevents a compromised user account from accessing endpoints and other resources in the network, limiting attackers’ ability to move laterally regardless of the account’s Active Directory state or privilege level. It is automatically triggered by high-fidelity signals indicating that a compromised user account is being used in an ongoing attack. With user containment, even compromised domain admin accounts cannot help attackers access other devices in the network.</blockquote>
