<blockquote>Artificial intelligence (AI) may still hold the potential to solve some of the worldâ€™s most intractable problems [...], but when it comes to risks to privacy and civil liberties, AI already has been a game changer in favor of authoritarian states. AI-enabled tools have turbocharged every pre-existing form of repression including: mass and targeted surveillance, censorship, and the spread of propaganda. </blockquote>
<p>Retired Ambassador Eileen Donahoe outlines that democratic nations must:
<ol>
<li>Develop and showcase a democratic model of digital restraint at home</li>
<li>Exercise leadership in international tech diplomacy and standard setting</li>
<li>Invest in tech innovation as a means of advancing democratic values</li>
</ol>
