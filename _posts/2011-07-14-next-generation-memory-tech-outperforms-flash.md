I mean, they all do, but this is still a pretty impressive experiment:
<blockquote>The devices presented here are 30nm thick, and the switching current is 50 μA - an order of magnitude smaller than that of PRAM. They also demonstrated an endurance of greater than 10<sup>12</sup> switching cycles (higher than the previous best of 10<sup>10</sup> and six orders of magnitude higher than that of flash memory at 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup>). The device has a switching time of 10ns, and a data retention time estimated to be 10 years at 85°C. This type of RRAM also appears to work without problems in a vacuum, unlike previously-demonstrated devices.</blockquote>
