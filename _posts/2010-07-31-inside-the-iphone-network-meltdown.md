An in-depth article on AT&T and the iPhone:

<blockquote>What is clear is that AT&T's role will always be that of parsimonious gatekeeper, dictating to its customers how much data they can have and how much they'll pay for it. In a fate that will soon befall the rest of the wireless carriers, AT&T has become a mere toll-taker on the digital highway, an operator of dumb pipes that cost a fortune to maintain but garner no credit for innovation or customer service.</blockquote>
