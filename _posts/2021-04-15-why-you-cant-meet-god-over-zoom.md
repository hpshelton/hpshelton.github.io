<blockquote><p>It is true that Zoom religious services are fundamentally inadequate. This is not a criticism of the clergy and lay leaders who have put in tremendous creative effort. In a sense it is an indictment of the very idea of what we look for in church, and a chance to realign our perspective. That is because even in-person services are, in a sense, inadequate.</p><p>[...]</p><p>Instead of encountering the transcendent, we bump against the limits of human talent.</p></blockquote>
