<blockquote>The University of California last week tentatively agreed to a deal with UC-AFT, the University of California chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, that included a new provision barring the system and its campuses from creating online courses or programs that would result in "a change to a term or condition of employment" of any lecturer without first dealing with the union.</blockquote>
