<blockquote>Technology is an enabler of rights, not a right itself. There is a high bar for something to be considered a human right. Loosely put, it must be among the things we as humans need in order to lead healthy, meaningful lives, like freedom from torture or freedom of conscience.</blockquote>
<p>Vinton Cerf make a good argument for the Internet as a civil right, however, and calls on engineers to work to guarantee the safety and security of users seeking to obtain, use, and share information in pursuit of human rights. Absolutely the right position.</p>
