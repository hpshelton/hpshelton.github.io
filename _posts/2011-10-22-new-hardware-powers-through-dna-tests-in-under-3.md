<blockquote>The Polymerase Chain Reaction, which amplifies specific DNA sequences out of mixtures, has revolutionized molecular biology, enabling DNA-based tests that once took months to be performed in an afternoon. But even an afternoon is pretty slow for some purposes. A team of impatient researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab has now managed to cut the time needed for a PCR reaction down from a few hours to less than three minutes.</blockquote>
