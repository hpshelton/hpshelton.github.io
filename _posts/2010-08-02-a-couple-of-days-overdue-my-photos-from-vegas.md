A couple of days overdue, my photos from Vegas - casinos, gambling, lights, noise, people, and a disappointing hike in Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area, one of the best climbing locations in the US, I was told. I did come out of Vegas with more money than I went in, though - $50 ahead on five rounds of blackjack. Lance Burton's magic show was also quite exquisite and wonderfully enjoyable.
