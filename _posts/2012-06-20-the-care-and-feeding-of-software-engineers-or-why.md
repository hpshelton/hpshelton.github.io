<blockquote><p>I have a theory. That theory is that software engineers see themselves very differently than those with whom they work. I've come to this conclusion after over a decade in the software industry working at companies large and small. Companies (product managers, designers, other managers) tend to look at software engineers as builders. It's the job of the product manager to dream up what to build, the job of the designer to make it aesthetically pleasing, and the job of the engineer to build what they came up with. Basically, engineers are looked at as the short-order cooks of the industry.</p><p>And here's the real crux of the problem: software engineers aren't builders. Software engineers are creators.</p></blockquote>
