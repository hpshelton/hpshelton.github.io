<blockquote>According to NPD's report, as the industry grows consumers are beginning to access a broader array of content and services, and they are doing so from more devices. Although 75 percent of U.S. consumers (age 13 and older) did not connect or download content in the previous three months, 15 percent connected and downloaded content via PC or Mac computer; 6 percent connected with a video-game player; 4 percent connected via smartphone; and 2 percent connected via a Blu-ray Disc (BD) or digital video player.</blockquote>
If this NPD survey is to be believed, only 15% of US consumers have downloaded "music, video, gam[es] and other forms of entertainment" (ebooks, apps, etc). 15% of consumers have contributed somewhere around <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/06/23/app-store-1-of-apples-gross-profit/">$2 billion dollars</a> to Apple's bottom line in the iTunes store in the last year (including <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/05/14/about-those-iphone-app-store-numbers/">app store</a>). They <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2010/05/21/us-digital-music-sales-exceeded-physical-media-in-2009/">downloaded more music</a> than physical discs were sold. They download around <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2010/06/08/itunes-the-most-accounts-of-any-store-on-the-web/">9.3 million songs per day</a>! And let's not even talk about ebooks (mainly 'cause Amazon doesn't release numbers). Either their numbers are wrong, or those of us who are connected spend way too much money on digital entertainment.
