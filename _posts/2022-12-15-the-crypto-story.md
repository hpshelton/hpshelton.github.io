<blockquote>There was a moment not so long ago when I thought, "What if I've had this crypto thing all wrong?" I'm a doubting normie who, if I'm being honest, hasn't always understood this alternate universe that's been percolating and expanding for more than a decade now. If you're a disciple, this new dimension is the future. If you're a skeptic, this upside-down world is just a modern Ponzi scheme that's going to end badly â€” and the recent "crypto winter" is evidence of its long-overdue ending. But crypto has dug itself into finance, into technology, and into our heads. And if crypto isn't going away, we'd better attempt to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-10-25/10-takeaways-from-matt-levine-s-the-crypto-story">understand it</a>. Which is why we asked the finest finance writer around, Matt Levine of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion">Bloomberg Opinion</a>, to write a cover-to-cover issue of Bloomberg Businessweek, something a single author has done only one other time in the magazine's 93-year history ("<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">What Is Code?</a>," by Paul Ford). What follows is his brilliant explanation of what this maddening, often absurd, and always fascinating technology means, and where it might go.</blockquote>
