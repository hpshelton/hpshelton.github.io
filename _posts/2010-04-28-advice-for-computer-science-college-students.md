Joel Spolsky is rapidly becoming one of my favorite people to read:
<blockquote>
1. Learn how to write before graduating.<br>
2. Learn C before graduating.<br>
3. Learn microeconomics before graduating.<br>
4. Don't blow off non-CS classes just because they're boring.<br>
5. Take programming-intensive courses.<br>
6. Stop worrying about all the jobs going to India.<br>
7. No matter what you do, get a good summer internship.</blockquote>
