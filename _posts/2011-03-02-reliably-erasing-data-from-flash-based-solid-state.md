We've got built-in sanitize commands, overwriting, encryption, and my favorite:
<blockquote>
3.2.3 Degaussing<br>
<br>
We also evaluated degaussing as a method for erasing
SSDs. Degaussing is a fast, effective means of destroying hard drives, since it removes the disks low-level formatting (along with all the data) and damages the drive motor.<br>
...<br>
In all cases, the data remained intact.</blockquote>

Yeah, it's apparently a tricky litte feat...
