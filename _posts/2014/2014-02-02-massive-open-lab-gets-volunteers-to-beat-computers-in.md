<blockquote>37,000 enthusiasts were given the chance to take on algorithms in designing new RNA molecules. And once the gamers had a chance to vote on the best designs, the winning designs were sent to a lab, synthesized, and tested. After a few rounds of this, players were not only handily beating the computers but providing rules that went into designing the next-generation algorithm.</blockquote>
