<blockquote>Rather than breaking apart the fuel molecule through combustion, solar thermal fuels release heat by rearranging bonds within a molecule, leaving all the atoms in place. As a result, they can be recycled repeatedly.</blockquote>
<p>Horray for organic chemistry! I'm pretty sure azobenzene was our class's primary example of cis- and trans- isomers, and using the molecular rotation for energy storage is quite clever.</p>
