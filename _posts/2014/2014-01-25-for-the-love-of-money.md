<blockquote>In my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million â€” and I was angry because it wasn't big enough. I was 30 years old, had no children to raise, no debts to pay, no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted.</blockquote>
