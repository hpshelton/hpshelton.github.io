<blockquote>If you ask me why kids are going high church, I'd say it's because the single greatest threat to our generation and to young people nowadays is the deprivation of meaning in our lives. In the liturgical space, everything becomes meaningful. ... We're so thirsty for meaning that goes deeper, that can speak to our entire lives, hearts, and wallets, that we're really thirsty to be attached to the earth and to each other and to God. The liturgy is a historical way in which that happens.</blockquote>
