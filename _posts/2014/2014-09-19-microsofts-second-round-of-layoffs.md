<p>These hit pretty close to home; Microsoft Research Silicon Valley and the Exchange Customer Engineering team, consisting of mostly former Outlook.com testers and the team that I was on two weeks ago, are both gone. Some good co-workers are being asked to turn in their badges. I wish them the best of luck.</p>
