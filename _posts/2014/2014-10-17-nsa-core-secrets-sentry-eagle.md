<p>Some more disturbing stuff in the latest set of NSA leaks. Given, the fact that the NSA works with foreign and domestic companies and gained physical access to infrastructure isn't new, but the stuff that is is scary and the list of ECI program descriptions is telling:</p>
<blockquote>In addition to so-called "close access" operations, the NSA's "core secrets" include the fact that the agency works with U.S. and foreign companies to weaken their encryption systems; the fact that the NSA spends "hundreds of millions of dollars" on technology to defeat commercial encryption; and the fact that the agency works with U.S. and foreign companies to penetrate computer networks, possibly without the knowledge of the host countries. Many of the NSA's core secrets concern its relationships to domestic and foreign corporations.</blockquote>
