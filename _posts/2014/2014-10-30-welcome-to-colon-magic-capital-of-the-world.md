<blockquote>[...] Colon, Michigan, a sleepy, one-streetlight town somewhere between Detroit and Chicago [...] proudly bills itself as "The Magic Capital of the World." It's home to around 1,000 residents and holds at least 30 dead magicians in its single small graveyard. The Colon High School mascot is a giant bunny rabbit. Though it lacks the soaring Gothic cathedrals of Hogwarts, it just might be the most magical place in the United States.</blockquote>
