<blockquote><p>While PM/Dev/Business Team may hope it works right, or ships on time, or sells enough, Hope is <i>not</i> a valid Testing Technique.  Hope is another way of saying "Assume". Neither has a place in Test.</p>
<p>Testers do not Hope. They prove or disprove. We are paid to find invalid assumptions, not make them ourselves.</p></blockquote>
