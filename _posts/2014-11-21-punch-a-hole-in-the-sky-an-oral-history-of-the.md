<blockquote>When we were at Edwards Air Force Base, we really had the run of the place. We'd be right along the runways. Some pilots would get ticked off because we were too close. ... One pilot landed and was like, "Who the hell are you?! What's going on?! Who's in charge?!" Finally Chuck Yeager turns around, and the guy's face suddenly fell. He said, "Oh, General, I'm really sorry, I didn't realize that you were with these guys." You could do anything you wanted at Edwards as long as Yeager was around.</blockquote>
