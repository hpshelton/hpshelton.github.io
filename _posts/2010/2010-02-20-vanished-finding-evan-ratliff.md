<i>Wired</i> editor Ean Ratliff attempted to disappear and recreate a new identity. To make it harder, hundreds of people were looking for him for a chance to win $5,000.

I'm not sure if the scariest part of this article is what he was able to do without an identity or what the people who were hunting him were able to do.
