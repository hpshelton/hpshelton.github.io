<blockquote>The Board of Equalization collects California state sales and use tax, as well as fuel, alcohol, and tobacco taxes and fees that provide revenue for state government and essential funding for counties, cities, and special districts.</blockquote>

The "Board of Equalization" sounds like the "The Board of Take My Money Away and Never Give It Back". At least I get to vote on who does that.
