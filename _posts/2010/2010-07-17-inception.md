I can safely say that <i>Inception</i> is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The comparisons to the breakthrough in action cinematics in <i>The Matrix</i> is well-deserved. Great plot, good acting, and a fantastic score make it truly engaging. At the end, it feels like you've been in a dream, and you don't want to wake up.
