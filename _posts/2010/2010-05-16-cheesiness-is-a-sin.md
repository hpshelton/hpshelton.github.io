<blockquote>Authentic movies, ones that portray the honest complexities of life, challenge us, move us, and inspire reflection—but authenticity is hard to come by in Christian films.

The Christian film industry's offerings are easy to dismiss, not necessarily for their message, but for their artlessness—their predictable plots, clumsy moralizing, and sentimental endings.</blockquote>
