<blockquote>
Our world finds godliness boring and purity unattractive. I think before he sinned, Adam found it a turn-on. As Christians, shouldn't we experience it that way too? I don't mean you should lust after the godly girls in your church! I simply mean that if God is the standard of beauty, then the more of God you see in them, the more you see that is attractive.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But if the physical or personal is entirely (or mainly) what attracts you and these are your highest priorities, then your problem is not with the women around you. Your problem is with God. The more you are in love with the beauty of Jesus Christ, the more you will be attracted to what you see of Him in the woman you're dating and the more important it will be to you. The less you love Him, the more important other things about her will become, things like her figure or style.
</blockquote>

<p>Romans 1:18-22 talks about how God revealed Himself and His beauty and man rejected it. We rejected His standard for women and the beauty He has set upon you. Adam screwed it up, but Jesus redeemed beauty from the world of sin, picked it up off the ground, and washed it clean.</p>

<blockquote>
Think about what that means. Jesus didn't come to earth looking for a beautiful bride, going back to heaven disappointed because no one lived up to His standards. No, He worked actively creating beauty through His death on the cross and the power of the gospel. He gave His life so that whoever repents of their sin and puts their faith in His finished work on the cross might become part of His dazzlingly beautiful bride! It's a promise He made and it's a promise He will keep.
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus created a dazzling, beautiful bride! He spent His entire life to demonstrate the beauty of God and beauty from God. From Ephesians 5:25-27, we are called to love, honor, and cherish you ladies, just as Christ did! With our <b>entire</b> lives. A tough standard. Just as Jesus worked to reveal the authentic beauty He treasures, so we are called to as well. </p>
<p><b>Ladies:</b></p>
<p>I pray that the men in your life, including myself, will be invested with the power of God to live up to that standard, for it is only with His power that we can reform our idea of female beauty, just as it is only through His power that you can reform your ideas of yours. I pray that those around you will cherish the incorruptible beauty you have in your heart and strengthen and protect that beauty.</p>

<p><b>Gentlemen:</b></p>
<p>May we take this message to heart and show the ladies around us that there is a better definition of beauty, and that we believe in it. May we devote our lives to creating beauty, cherishing it, and protecting it in those around us.<p>
<p>Happy Valentine's Day,<br>
