It only took another three hours in the DMV, a barely passing score on a written driver's test I didn't know I was going to have to take, and way too much money in new vehicle registration sales tax, and I have plates, a license, and a temporary voter's card. I am, as of today, officially registered as a Californian. And a Republican. And an organ donor. 

Pardon me while I go wash my car and take a scalding shower.
