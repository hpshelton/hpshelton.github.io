<blockquote>The authors of the study argue that the root of all these tasks involves making a probabilistic inference, where complete information is missing, so people have to make a best guess based on known odds. Video gaming, in their view, increases the efficiency at which people can process the odds and make an accurate decisionâ€”gamers simply can do more with less.</blockquote>
An interesting benefit of technology on cognitive function.
