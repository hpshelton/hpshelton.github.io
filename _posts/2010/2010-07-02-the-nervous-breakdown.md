<blockquote>With the rise of new media has come the redefinition of <i>privacy</i>. No longer is privacy simply the condition of withdrawal from public view or company; it now suggests the active ability to control what the public sees of you, as well as your availability to said company. And in light of the social network revolution, the significance of <i>popularity</i> is also being reconsidered.</blockquote>
