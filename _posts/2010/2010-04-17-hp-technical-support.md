Things I learned (or relearned) from my 2 hour call with HP tech support this afternoon:
<ul>
<li>Always get their number, even if they're supposed to call you back in 30 minutes.</li>
<li>hp.com/#product may take you directly to your computer's support site.</li>
<li>Tech support doesn't know the difference between hardware and software.</li>
<li>I'm <i>really</i> glad I got an AppleCare warranty.</li>
<li>Apple may be the #1 in customer satisfaction because it has no competition in the competency department.</li>
</ul>
I'm really glad I own a Mac today. Given, it's had its own set of problems. But I got them fixed. In a reasonable amount of time.
