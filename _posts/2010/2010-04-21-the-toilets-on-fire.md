<p>
<strong>Me:</strong> I can't believe I'm playing this well while trying to re-derive Boltzmann's distribution...<br/>
<strong>Daniel:</strong> My roommate just lit the toilet on fire<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> ?<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> On purpose or on accident?<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> And you're still playing chess?<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> Shouldn't you evacuate?<br/>
<strong>Daniel:</strong> He poured lighter fluid in it so it would make a funny sound.<br/>
<strong>Daniel:</strong> (it didn't).<br/>
...<br/>
<strong>Daniel:</strong> He just tried gas. Fireball + charred seat = bad<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> I can't tell if you're laughing or crying about this...<br/>
