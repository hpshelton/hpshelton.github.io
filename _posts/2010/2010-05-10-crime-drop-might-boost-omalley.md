<blockquote>Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is scheduled to announce Monday that the state recorded fewer violent crimes last year than at any point since 1979 and that the overall number of crimes dipped to an all-time low since Maryland police began uniformly reporting them more than 35 years ago.</blockquote>
Still,<blockquote>Homicides in Baltimore increased by four, to 238, last year. A year earlier, the city had the fifth most homicides among U.S. cities.</blockquote>
