Well today was interesting. A short drive from Zion National Park brought me to the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park (the higher rim), and after a brief lunch, I tackled the North Kaibab Trail. The fact that it had just finished raining meant that the crowds were small, it was cool (though humid), and there was actually water running down the canyon. I hiked down to Redwall Bridge, which can barely be seen in the third picture. It was a total of 5.2 miles round-trip, with a 2,150 ft. descent/ascent. I did it in 3 hours, which means I ascended as fast as I descended (I blame the pictures). For reference, Observation Point yesterday had a 2,148 elevation change and it took me 6 hours.

I then drove out to Imperial Point to check out the view. Figures it started thunderstorming just as I got out there. The pictures probably won't be any good, but we'll see. Should have stayed a bit longer 'cause it stopped as soon as I left. No sunsets or sunrises, either. Oh, well. On to Las Vegas tomorrow morning.
