<blockquote>With iPods and iPads; Xboxes and PlayStations; information becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment, rather than a tool of empowerment. All of this is not only putting new pressures on you; it is putting new pressures on our country and on our democracy.</blockquote>
I feel that this quote is being taken out of context frequently. The rest of his speech is about the power of education and democracy, and is actually very good.
