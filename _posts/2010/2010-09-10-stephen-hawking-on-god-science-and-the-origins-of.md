In philosophy and logic there is a principle know as Occam's Razor. It says that the simplest explanation is the most likely one. Apparently for one of the world's leading minds (or many), the simplest explanation is that there are infinite universes, many dimensions, and a whole host of mathematics to govern them. That however, is self-defeating. Where there are laws and behavior, there is something higher to govern them. This is Aquinas' fifth proof for the existence of God. And these constructs must themselves also have come from somewhere - Aquinas' second proof.

Don't get me wrong - his books are on my reading list. It's just sad to see someone so brilliant and educated ignore Truth.
