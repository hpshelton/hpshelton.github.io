<blockquote>A leader of one of America's largest Christian denominations wants his name removed from a statement calling for a more civil national discourse. Why? Too many of the wrong sort of Christians have signed the statement.<br>
<br>
"The problem is the tent that has grown so large on the signatures of this that are including people who are supportive of gay marriage and abortion rights," explained a spokesman for George O. Wood, general superintendent of the Assemblies of God, the nation's second largest Pentecostal groups.<br>
<br>
Is it an act of incivility to have your name removed from a "Covenant for Civility"?</blockquote>
