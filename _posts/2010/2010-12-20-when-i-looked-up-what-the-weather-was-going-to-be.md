<p>When I looked up what the weather was going to be this week at home, I forgot to add "TX" to the end of the query, so I ended up with the results for blizzard-wrecked Illinois:
</p><div style="text-align:center"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="374" data-orig-width="500"><img style="margin:5px" name="weather_image" src="/assets/images/61ed9373f72b502e502dd9ec3142d9a2777c9e65.png" onmouseover="document.weather_image.src='/assets/images/tumblr_ldpbpcksy41qaf504.png'" onmouseout="document.weather_image.src='/assets/images/tumblr_ldpbp3nbCX1qaf504.png'" data-orig-height="374" data-orig-width="500"></figure>
(Rollover to see the difference).</div>

Glad it's not going to be 15 degrees on Christmas day.
