This is currently one of the most-read stories on CNN.
<blockquote>Monogamy does have a place in relationships, but not on the long-term. Men are hard-wired to betray women on the long-term.</blockquote>
While this might be biologically true, this article just goes to show that the vows of marriage are meaningless to so many people. Men are called to sacrifice their desires for their wife:

<blockquote>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her.</blockquote> - Ephesians 5:25
