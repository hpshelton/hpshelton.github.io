<blockquote>Meanwhile, Sachin Agarwal is writing that <a href="http://sachin.posterous.com/the-web-sucks">The Web Sucks</a>, again talking about the web as an application platform:<br>
<br>
Web applications don't have threading, GPU acceleration, drag and drop, copy and paste of rich media, true offline access, or persistence. Are you kidding me?<br>
<br>
There, in that quote, is where I want to pull all of this together. Sachin's complaint has absolutely nothing to do with the web. Think about that word; 'web'. Think about why it was so named. It's nothing to do with rich applications. Everything about web architecture; HTTP, HTML, CSS, is designed to serve and render content, but most importantly the web is formed where all of that content is linked together. That is what makes it amazing, and that is what defines it. This purpose and killer application of the web is not even comparable to the application frameworks of any particular operating system.<br>
<br>
That's the kicker. We talk about 'web applications', the 'open web stack'. People are citing HP's purchase of Palm and investment in WebOS as a victory for the web. We talk about applications built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the same breath as content published using HTML semantics.<br>
<br>
Want to know if your 'HTML application' is part of the web? Link me into it. Not just link me to it; link me into it. Not just to the black-box frontpage. Link me to a piece of content. Show me that it can be crawled, show me that we can draw strands of silk between the resources presented in your app. That is the web: The beautiful interconnection of navigable content. If your website locks content away in a container, outside the reach of hyperlinks, you're not building any kind of 'web' app. You're doing something else.<br>
<br>
Palm WebOS applications are awesome, but they are not part of the web. An app might interact with data on the web, and they are built with similar HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies. That's great, but they are not a connected, interlinked part of the web.<br>
<br>
We're talking about two very different things: The web of information and content, and a desire for a free, cross-platform Cocoa or .NET quality application framework that runs in the browsers people already use. The latter cause is louder, and risks stomping over the more valuable, more important, more culturally indispensable part of the web.</blockquote>
