<blockquote>Everyone applauds the hyper-connectedness we're experiencing today. The truth is we can't really leverage it in a very meaningful way. There are a chosen few that get proper attention, the rest just end up in a sort of long tail of human connections. They're relegated to an almost trivial status â€“ only acknowledged as a scored point on your "friends" or "followers" tally.</blockquote>
This is why I don't have a Facebook. Yes, it's a great communication tool, but I want to be worried about the people around me, not the ones I haven't seen in years. But, after reconnecting with so many great friends at a wedding last week, I'm hopeful that the most important relationships still happen.
