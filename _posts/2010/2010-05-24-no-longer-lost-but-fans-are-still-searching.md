<blockquote>But when the entire island story line we had been following for six seasons turned out not to matter very much within the internal organization of the show's narrative — to be largely disconnected from that final quasi-religious resolution of the plot — it was deflating, despite the warm feelings the finale otherwise inspired.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rendered insignificant, in this scenario, were the particulars of what they had done on the island. Pushing buttons, building rafts, blowing up hatches, living, dying — all the churning action and melodrama that made "Lost" so addictive in its early seasons — none of it was directly connected to this final outcome, beyond the fact that it constituted "the most important part" of all their lives.</blockquote>
