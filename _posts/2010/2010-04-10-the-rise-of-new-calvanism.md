A fantastic article from the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> on a theological and cultural shift in the American church today, between "emergence Christianity" and "new Calvanism".<br>
<br>
Since the article doesn't actually lay out a good definition of Calvanism, I thought I'd give a short introduction. The main beliefs of Calvanism are often distilled into the "five points":

<ul>
<li><b>T</b>otal Depravity (also known as Total Inability or Original Sin)</li>
We are completely sinful, and in complete enmity with God in our natural state, unable to, of our own will, turn to God for salvation.
<li><b>U</b>nconditional Election </li>
God elects, or chooses, some to be saved, and others not, by virtue of His will, not our actions or our future choice to have faith.
<li><b>L</b>imited Atonement</li> 
Jesus died only for those elected by God. Though Jesus' sacrifice was and is sufficient for all, it was not efficacious for all.
<li><b>I</b>rresistible Grace</li> 
The elect cannot resist the working of the Holy Spirit that brings them to a position in which they willingly come to God.
<li><b>P</b>erseverance of the Saints (or Once Saved Always Saved)</li>
Those truly saved are eternally secure in Christ. No action can cause the loss of salvation.
</ul>
These can be abbreviated as "TULIP" for those of you who are acronym-minded.<br>
<br>
The "opposite" interpretation of the Scriptures that support Calvanism lead to a theology known as Arminianism. Finally, one can believe in any or all of the above points, making them what people label a "4-point" or "5-point" Calvanist, for example. If I were to label myself, I would be a "4-1/2-point Calvanist", as I have difficulty with unconditional election as I don't think it properly describes a God who is outside of time.<br>
<br>
As the article says: "Today we have more Bibles and more study guides to Scripture than ever before, but people know the text itself less and less."
I would encourage you to know what the Bible says, to, in the words of <i>The Matrix</i>, "know thyself", to what you believe, and to be prepared to give account to God for those beliefs and your resulting lifestyle as in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:1-12&version=NKJV">Romans 14:1-12</a>.
