<p>Be sure to read Bradley's <a href="http://online.worldmag.com/2010/06/02/mishandling-twentysomethings/">full article</a> for the full context.</p>

<p>Yes, I am a Christian twentysomething, and yes, I have been told on numerous occasions that I should be a pastor. But there is first a distinction between the role of a pastor and the spiritual gift of pastoring. I know many with the latter that will never fulfill the former. Second, I was fortunate enough to be told by the pastor I most respect, "If you can do anything other than full-time ministry, do it. God needs Godly people in the workforce more than He needs them in the Church."</p>
