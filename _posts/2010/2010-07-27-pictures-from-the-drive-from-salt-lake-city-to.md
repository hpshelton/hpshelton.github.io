Pictures from the drive from Salt Lake City to Zion National Park. The pictures of the canyon are from the scenic drive at Kolob Canyons in Zion National Park, and they don't even begin to give justice to how pretty the scenery was. Kinda disappointed in myself as a photographer, actually. I'm going to have to use way more of the manual features tomorrow.
