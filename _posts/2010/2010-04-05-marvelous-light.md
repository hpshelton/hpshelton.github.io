<blockquote>But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His <b>marvelous light</b>; who once were not a people, but now are the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy.</blockquote>
-1 Peter 1:9-10<br>

I got several comments from people about why I didn't post anything yesterday on Easter. Truth is, I'm still mulling over what the "take-home" message is for me this year, in a sense. After meditating over this verse all week, I think the message is this: having been redeemed by Christ, let us walk in Him. <br>
<br>
Let me elaborate. The miracle of Easter is less about the fact that Jesus died for our sins and more about the fact that Jesus rose to invite us into His Life. As Marty says, the stone was rolled back not for Jesus to get out, but for us to come in and see it with our own eyes, to experience His resurrection. The Light of the World has given us an invitation, chosen us as "His own special people", the "people of God." We are, in turn, to honor that by walking in His "marvelous light."<br>
<br>
Carolyn prayed something last night that has really stayed with me. Emmanuel, God with us, is the name of Jesus not because He was born and walked among us, fully God and fully man. It is His name because He walks among us still. He emerged from the grave in darkness and brought forth the song all creation had been longing to hear, the shout of victory of the King, and the light and love of God.<br>
<br>
I think one verse of "In Christ Alone" says the whole thing:
<blockquote>There in the ground His body lay,<br>
Light of the World by darkness slain.<br>
Then bursting forth in glorious day,<br> 
Up from the grave He rose again!<br> 
And as He stands in victory,<br>
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,<br> 
For I am His and He is mine,<br>
Bought with the precious blood of Christ!</blockquote><br>

We are His, and are called to walk as such, not just on Easter, just as Christ lives not just on Easter.<br>
