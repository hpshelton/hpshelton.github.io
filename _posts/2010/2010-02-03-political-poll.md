"Research 2000, a non-partisan firm that polls for the liberal Web site Daily Kos, surveyed 2,003 Republicans between Jan. 20 and Jan. 31. The poll had a margin of error of 2.2 percent. It showed, among Republicans, 53 percent believe Palin is more qualified to be president than Obama. Just 14 percent think otherwise."

God help us all.
