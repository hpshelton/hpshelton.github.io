<blockquote>In a triumph of experimental physics, a team of scientists from the University of New South Wales, in Australia, report that they have managed to detect the magnetic state, or spin, of a single electron in a silicon chip. This is the first time that such a feat has been accomplished, and it is a promising step toward the development of silicon-based quantum computers, say the scientists.</blockquote>

Oh, phosphorus doping. But seriously, really cool result.
