<blockquote>Praise to the Lord, who, when tempests their warfare are waging,
Who, when the elements madly around thee are raging,
Biddeth them cease, turneth their fury to peace,
Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.</blockquote>

 â€” <p><a href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/music/Praise_to_the_Lord_the_Almighty/"><i>Praise to the Lord, the Almighty</i></a>, Joachim Neander, 1680</p>

<p>I've never sung this verse, but I heard it in a recording and I really like it.</p>
