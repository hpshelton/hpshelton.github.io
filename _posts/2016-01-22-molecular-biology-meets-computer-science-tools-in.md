<p><blockquote><p>A team of researchers from Microsoft and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard has developed a new system that allows researchers to more quickly and effectively use the powerful gene editing tool CRISPR.</p>
<p>In this case, the machine learning system is being used to predict which part of a gene to target when a scientist wants to knockout – or shut off – a gene. Machine learning enables the model to make predictions for any gene of interest, including those not seen in the experimental training data. </p></blockquote></p>
