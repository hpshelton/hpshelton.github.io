<blockquote><p>This report documents the widespread adoption of [mobile device forensic tools] by law enforcement in the United States. Based on 110 public records requests to state and local law enforcement agencies across the country, our research documents more than 2,000 agencies that have purchased these tools, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We found that state and local law enforcement agencies have performed hundreds of thousands of cellphone extractions since 2015, often without a warrant. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such records have been widely disclosed.</p>

<p>Every American is at risk of having their phone forensically searched by law enforcement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some very common-sense policy recommendations about how to balance law-enforcement and 4th Amendment concerns at the end.</p>
