<blockquote>Surely he took up our pain<br>
and bore our suffering,<br>
yet we considered him punished by God,<br>
stricken by him, and afflicted.<br>
But he was pierced for our transgressions,<br>
he was crushed for our iniquities;<br>
the punishment that brought us peace was on him,<br>
and by his wounds we are healed.</blockquote>
