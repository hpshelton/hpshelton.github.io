<blockquote>Startups are run by people who do what's necessary at the time it's needed. A lot of time that's unglamorous work. A lot of times that's not heroic work. Is that heroic? Is that standing on a stage in a black turtleneck, in front of 20,000 people talking about the future of phones? No. But that's how companies are built. That person who did that for the iPhone launch at Apple, we don't know who he is. All we know is that Steve Jobs came up with the iPhone. But he didn't ship it. The person who bought the donuts did.</blockquote>
