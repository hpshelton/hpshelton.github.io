<blockquote>Why would God create the heart to be so tender and yet allow it to be exposed to such an intense variety of life experiences?  A fully lived life requires a fully-experienced life. Without both joy and sorrow, peace and turmoil, happiness and despair, you cannot fully appreciate any one experience. For a life to be fully lived, it must be experienced in every extreme. The extent to which we are capable of experiencing great disappointment and pain is also the extent to which we have the capacity to experience the greatest joy.  God wired us for fullness, and our hearts require full exposure for real, authentic life to flow.  While we would never choose the extreme moments, they are part of the plan of God.</blockquote>
