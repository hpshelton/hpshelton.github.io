<blockquote>The United States government violated the Fourth Amendment with its suspicionless searches of international travelers' phones and laptops, a federal court <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/alasaad_opinion_summary_judgment.pdf">ruled</a> [...].</blockquote>
<blockquote>"This ruling significantly advances Fourth Amendment protections for the millions of international travelers who enter the United States every year," ACLU staff attorney Esha Bhandari said. "By putting an end to the government's ability to conduct suspicionless fishing expeditions, the court reaffirms that the border is not a lawless place and that we don't lose our privacy rights when we travel."</blockquote>
