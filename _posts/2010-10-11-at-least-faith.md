<blockquote>We all know the "neon sins" we're not supposed to do. We all know the big things we should avoid like the plague. Adultery, murder, money laundering, robbing banks, chances are if I suggested we shouldn't do those things you'd agree. There's nothing groundbreaking about that. But sometimes we play the "at least game."</blockquote>
