<p>David Brooks presents a history of the family and some shocking (and frankly) depressing statistics about its decline:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our culture is oddly stuck. We want stability and rootedness, but also mobility, dynamic capitalism, and the liberty to adopt the lifestyle we choose. We want close families, but not the legal, cultural, and sociological constraints that made them possible. We've seen the wreckage left behind by the collapse of the detached nuclear family. We've seen the rise of opioid addiction, of suicide, of depression, of inequality â€” all products, in part, of a family structure that is too fragile, and a society that is too detached, disconnected, and distrustful. And yet we can't quite return to a more collective world. The words the historians Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg wrote in 1988 are even truer today: "Many Americans are groping for a new paradigm of American family life, but in the meantime a profound sense of confusion and ambivalence reigns."</p></blockquote>
<p>Our politics should adapt to reflect this new reality, but it is also stuck:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the social structures that support the family have decayed, the debate about it has taken on a mythical quality. Social conservatives insist that we can bring the nuclear family back. But the conditions that made for stable nuclear families in the 1950s are never returning. Conservatives have nothing to say to the kid whose dad has split, whose mom has had three other kids with different dads; "go live in a nuclear family" is really not relevant advice. If only a minority of households are traditional nuclear families, that means the majority are something else: single parents, never-married parents, blended families, grandparent-headed families, serial partnerships, and so on. Conservative ideas have not caught up with this reality.</p>

<p>Progressives, meanwhile, still talk like self-expressive individualists of the 1970s: <i>People should have the freedom to pick whatever family form works for them.</i> And, of course, they should. But many of the new family forms do not work well for most people [...].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end he celebrates the rise of found-families and kinship as a potential return to supportive extended-families structures.</p>
