<blockquote>In 2022, CISA conducted a red team assessment (RTA) at the request of a large
critical infrastructure organization with multiple geographically separated sites.
The team gained persistent access to the organization's network, moved laterally across the
organization's multiple geographically separated sites, and eventually gained access to systems
adjacent to the organization's sensitive business systems (SBSs). Multifactor authentication (MFA)
prompts prevented the team from achieving access to one SBS, and the team was unable to complete
its viable plan to compromise a second SBSs within the assessment period.</blockquote>
<p>Wow. Very impressed by the transparency shown in this report by the CISA red team. More of this, please.</p>
