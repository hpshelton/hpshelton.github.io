<p><blockquote><p>When asked what separates distributed systems from other fields of software engineering, the new engineer often cites latency, believing that's what makes distributed computation hard.</p>

<p>But they're wrong. What sets distributed systems engineering apart is the probability of failure and, worse, the probability of partial failure.</p></blockquote></p>
