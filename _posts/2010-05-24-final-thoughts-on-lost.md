While the emphasis in this series finale was on the heart of the island, the show lost its own heart. What was supposed to be a revealing, emotional, climactic episode endangered the whole series with an cop-out ending that clarified nothing, was neither epic nor mysterious nor surprising, and most of all, inspired no emotion for any of the characters. It basically pulled a Battlestar.
