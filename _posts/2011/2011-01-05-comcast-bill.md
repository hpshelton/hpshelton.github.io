My Comcast bill this month contains eight pages of "Important Information" about my cable services, four ad slices, a pay-per-view booklet, and a return envelope with an ad on the back. They're obviously overcharging me for Internet if they can afford to mail all this stuff that doesn't affect me and the service I have.
