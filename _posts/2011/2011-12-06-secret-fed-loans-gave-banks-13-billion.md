<blockquote><p>A fresh narrative of the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 emerges from 29,000 pages of Fed documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and central bank records of more than 21,000 transactions. While Fed officials say that almost all of the loans were repaid and there have been no losses, details suggest taxpayers paid a price beyond dollars as the secret funding helped preserve a broken status quo and enabled the biggest banks to grow even bigger.</p>
<p>Add up guarantees and lending limits, and the Fed had committed $7.77 trillion as of March 2009 to rescuing the financial system, more than half the value of everything produced in the U.S. that year.</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn't even know the U.S. government had $7.7 trillion to lend. This story disgusts me with the effort the banks and the Federal Reserve went to prevent disclosure of these deals.</p>
