<blockquote>Joe Weiss, a managing partner for Applied Control Solutions, cited an official government report from the state where the regional water district was located. It was dated November 10, two days after the hack was discovered. The document indicates that the utility had been experiencing unexplained problems with its computerized system in the weeks leading up to the breach.</blockquote>
<p>The researcher is concerned:</p>
<blockquote>What the hell is going on with DHS? Why aren't people being notified?</blockquote>
<p>DHS is apparently not:</p>
<blockquote>At this time there is no credible corroborated data that indicates a risk to critical infrastructure entities or a threat to public safety.</blockquote>
<p>Other than the "official government report" stating that the water utility was experiencing "unexplained problems," of course.</p>
