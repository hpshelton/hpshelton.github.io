An old man, going a lone highway,<br>
Came, at the evening, cold and gray,<br>
To a chasm, vast, and deep, and wide,<br>
Through which was flowing a sullen tide.<br>
<br>
The old man crossed in the twilight dim;<br>
The sullen stream had no fear for him;<br>
But he turned, when safe on the other side,<br>
And built a bridge to span the tide.<br>
<br>
"Old man," said a fellow pilgrim, near,<br>
"You are wasting strength with building here;<br>
Your journey will end with the ending day;<br>
You never again will pass this way;<br>
You've crossed the chasm, deep and wide-<br>
Why build you this bridge at the evening tide?"<br>
<br>
The builder lifted his old gray head:<br>
"Good friend, in the path I have come," he said,<br>
"There followeth after me today,<br>
A youth, whose feet must pass this way.<br>
<br>
This chasm, that has been naught to me,<br>
To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be.<br>
He, too, must cross in the twilight dim;<br>
Good friend, I am building this bridge for him."<br>
