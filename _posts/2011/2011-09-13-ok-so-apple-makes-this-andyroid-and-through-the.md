<blockquote>OK, so Apple makes this Andyroid and, through the mismanagement endemic to the company at the time, it's released into the wild. Years later, the Andyroid is caught by Microsoft, which reprogrammed and re-released it into the wild — but deliberately. It then gets hired by Google and acts as a Manchurian candidate within the company to funnel millions of dollars to Microsoft for doing jack squat.</blockquote>
