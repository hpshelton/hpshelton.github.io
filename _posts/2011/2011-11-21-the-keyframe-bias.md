<blockquote><p>The keyframe bias is rooted in the way our memory works. To cram more information into the canteloupe-sized piece of flesh between our ears, we spawn formulas and look for exceptions, discarding the predictable and retaining the keyframes.</p>
<p>It's easier to transmit and evaluate frozen moments than impart direct experiences, and our ability to look for keyframes and write off the rest is also how we refine the patterns in our head, how we learn and grow. At the same time, these processes can also lead us further from the truth, developing us in a way that ultimately inhibits growth. We must realize that the keyframes are merely slivers of our total experience, that the fullness of life happens between the frames.</p></blockquote>
<p>"The fullness of life happens between the frames." What a great line, what a great analogy, and such a good truth. Memories are not sufficient to recreate experiences and feelings.</p>
