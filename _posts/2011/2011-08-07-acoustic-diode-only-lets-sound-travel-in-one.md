<blockquote>The technology has several potential applications. In the case of soundproofing, the technology could enable true one-way transmission of sound (rather than the simple dispersion and muting performed by "soundproofing" foams). But perhaps more interestingly, the material could be used to harvest energy from sound waves.</blockquote>
