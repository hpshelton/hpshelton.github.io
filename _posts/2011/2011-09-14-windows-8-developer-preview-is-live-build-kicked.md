<p>Windows 8 Developer Preview is live! BUILD kicked off today with a massive keynote by Steve Sinofsky (and others) on the Metro UI, developer tools, apps, and Windows Live synchronization (and others), giving us the first public look at Windows 8. Check out the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/home/">Windows Dev Center</a> for tools and resources, <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">watch the keynote</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516">download the developer release</a> (pre-beta) with new coding tools, sample apps, and documentation.</p>
<p>It's so cool to finally get to show off things we've been talking about, seeing, and working on for months, and the reviews look promising so far. Many more announcements, tidbits, and releases yet to come. Stay tuned!</p>
