<p>Today Google launched a <a href="http://plus.google.com">beta</a> of their latest foray into social networking, social search, and social in general, called <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en-US/+/demo/">Google+</a>. Wired has a great <a href="
http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/06/inside-google-plus-social/all/1">writeup</a> about the design and engineering efforts and the purpose behind Google+, but I think this quote from the New York Times' coverage says it all:</p>

<blockquote>Mr. Gundotra and Mr. Horowitz said that knowing more about individual Google users would improve all Google products, including <i>ads</i>, search, YouTube and maps, because Google will learn what people like and eventually personalize those products.</blockquote>
<p>That's what the game's really all about.</p>
