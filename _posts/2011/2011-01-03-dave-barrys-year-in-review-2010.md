<blockquote>Let's put things into perspective: 2010 was not the worst year ever. There have been MUCH worse years. For example, toward the end of the Cretaceous Period, Earth was struck by an asteroid that wiped out about 75 percent of all of the species on the planet. Can we honestly say that we had a worse year than those species did?</blockquote>

Wonderfully humorous look back at 2010 from Dave Barry: health care, North Korea, the iPhone, BP, Chilean miners, and volcanoes. Delightful.
