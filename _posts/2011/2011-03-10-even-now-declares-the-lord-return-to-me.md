<blockquote>"Even now," declares the LORD, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"return to me with all your heart, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with fasting and weeping and mourning."
Rend your heart 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not your garments.
Return to the LORD your God, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is gracious and compassionate, 
slow to anger and abounding in love, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he relents from sending calamity. 
Who knows? He may turn and relent 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and leave behind a blessing— 
grain offerings and drink offerings 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD your God.</blockquote>

 — Joel 2:12-14 (from Ash Wednesday service)
