<blockquote><p>The privacy concern here is that because you no longer have to explicitly opt-in to share an item, you may accidentally share a page or an event that you did not intend others to see.</p>
<p>The advice is to log out of Facebook. But logging out of Facebook only de-authorizes your browser from the web application. A number of cookies (including your account number) are still sent along to all requests to facebook.com. <b>Even if you are logged out, Facebook still knows and can track every page you visit.</b> The only solution is to delete every Facebook cookie in your browser, or to use a separate browser for Facebook interactions.</blockquote>
<p>Subsequent requests to Facebook as a signed-out user still send nine different cookies, including your account number, to Facebook or to any page that interfaces with Facebook.</p>
