<blockquote>President Obama is planning to hand the U.S. Commerce Department authority over a forthcoming cybersecurity effort to create an Internet ID for Americans, a White House official said here today.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"We are not talking about a government-controlled system," U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said.</blockquote>
Because specifying how the private sector should implement this program doesn't mean it qualifies as a government-controlled system. Sounds kinda like the logic behind the new health care bill.<br>
<br>
This program will run into the same opposition the National ID system (HR 4633) did in 2002. Nobody wants a single point of failure or single point of malicious interest for identity. Until we know the details of the system, however, you can take a look at the <a href="http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/nationalidsystem.html">EFF's argument against National ID</a>.
