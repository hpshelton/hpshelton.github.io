<blockquote>And therein lies the real problem of web 2.0 — whether it takes the form of SEO-driven "news" or crowd-sourced accommodation. To make money — real money — at this game you have to attract millions, or tens of millions, of users. And when you're dealing with those kinds of numbers, it's literally impossible not to treat your users as pieces of data. It's ironic, but depressingly unsurprising, that web 2.0 is using faux socialization and democratization to create a world where everyone is reduced to a number on a spreadsheet.</blockquote>
