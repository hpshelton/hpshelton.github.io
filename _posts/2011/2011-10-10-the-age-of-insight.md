<blockquote>Whereas the last century was about making goods - food, clothing, cars, toys - cheap and plentiful, the twenty-first century will be about making insights into what will truly make us better off.</blockquote>
<p>This is a phenomenal piece that resonates so well with the entrepreneurial spirit I'm surrounded by right now and the beliefs, training, and education I was raised with. The assumptions of the last century about jobs, productivity, and economies are dying and the age of the industrial revolution and the age of mass production are being replaced by the age of insight.</p>
