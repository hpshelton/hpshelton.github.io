<strong>Senator Herb Kohl:</strong> Do you recognize that in the words that are used and antitrust kind of oversight, your market share constitutes monopoly, dominant ... special power dominant for a monopoly firm? You recognize you're in that area?<br/>
<strong>Eric Schmidt:</strong> I would agree, sir, that we're in that area.<br/>
<strong>Eric Schmidt:</strong> I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding of monopoly findings is this is a judicial process.<br/>
