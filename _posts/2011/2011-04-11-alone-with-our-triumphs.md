<blockquote>A society ... where each individual seeks their own success, by their own definition would truly be a great one. Rather than be envious of what others have and what others have done, and thus motivated to take from their lot so as to make ours larger absolutely and by comparison, we would be inspired to create our own triumphs. A society where people are more concerned with themselves and their improvement, rather than the affairs of others, would certainly be a more respectful and harmonious one. This was the American ideal.</blockquote>
There are so many more good words in here on creation, consumption, government, individualism, thought, and triumph.
