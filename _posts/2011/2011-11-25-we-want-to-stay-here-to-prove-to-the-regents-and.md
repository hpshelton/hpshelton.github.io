<blockquote>We want to stay here to prove to the regents and state that we are part of this movement and that we want our tuition to go back to what it used to be, which essentially should be free.</blockquote>
<p>â€” Oscar Varela, 21, a fifth-year economics major who helped organize Tuesday's Occupy Cal demonstrations (via <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jCkYKbCKQQeW0rXGuhLrjyLBVhfw?docId=cea5c2d3d174412198b326a4995cdbd2">The Associated Press</a>).</p>

<p>An economics major should surely know that tuition can't be free. Why do people (particularly in the UC system) think that education is a right and that a university is really anything other than a business? A generally philanthropic business, yes, but a business nonetheless.</p>
