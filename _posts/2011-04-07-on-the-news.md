<blockquote>I suspect that [in the future] we may be able to look back and see something shift right around nowâ€”see the point at which the way we read broke ranks with the way the news is made. We are no longer monogamous readers, loyal to a single source; rather, we read voraciously, looking for patterns, teasing out the things that matter to us, making connections, and then (often) writing about them ourselves. We are consumers of <i>news</i>, not <i>The News</i>.</blockquote>
