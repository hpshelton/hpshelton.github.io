While it's gotten generally good reviews, it's 500 MB. That's because it's pictures of text. This is not unlike how Photoshop, InDesign, and GoLive used to be used to make websites. If you're interested in the tools to do something the wrong way, Adobe has now made them available. Or you could use HTML5.
