I was a soccer referee for 4 years. We make bad calls occasionally, but we know it. We don't need your help. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/23/AR2010062305091.html">Washington Post</a> had a great article about Galarraga's blown perfect game:

<blockquote>If all the fans who grumble about calls actually tried to be a referee or umpire, there might be fewer complaints.</blockquote>

And the best part of that whole scenario? Galarraga shook the umpire's hand. How's that for classy sportsmanship?
