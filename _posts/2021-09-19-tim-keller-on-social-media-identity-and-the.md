<blockquote>So social media is not primarily a place of public discussion of ideas. The ideas are ways to define oneself and signal belonging to a group, as well as to assign identities to others by associating them with groups you oppose.</blockquote>
<p>Jesse Rice in <i>The Church of Facebook</i> noted that building one's identity in the social sphere was a form of co-creation, or of participating in God's management of the world, dispensation. That thought has always stuck with me and is here echoed in Chris Bail's book <i>Breaking the Social Media Prism</i>.</p>
