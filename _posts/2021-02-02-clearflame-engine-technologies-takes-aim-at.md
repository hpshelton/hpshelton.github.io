<blockquote>ClearFlame isn't redesigning the diesel engine. Instead, [CEO BJ] Johnson and co-founder and CTO Julie Blumreiter have developed a way to modify the internal components of the engine to alter its thermodynamics to be able to quickly ignite and combust decarbonized fuels. The company's technology means 80% to 90% of the diesel engine parts remain unchanged, according to Johnson.</blockquote>
