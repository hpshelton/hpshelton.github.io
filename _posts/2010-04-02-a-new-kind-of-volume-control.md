Why is it that HTML 5's video tag gets all the attention? This whole <audio> thing is really cool, too. I so happy that IronicSans gave it some attention. Check out his implementation* of a volume meter that goes from "whisper" to "shout".

*Implementation so technologically <strike>advanced</strike> cool that it only works in Firefox.
