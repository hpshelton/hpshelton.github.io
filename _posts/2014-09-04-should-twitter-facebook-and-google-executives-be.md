<blockquote><p>The question posed by Twitter's announcement is not whether you think it's a good idea for people to see the Foley video. Instead, the relevant question is whether you want Twitter, Facebook and Google executives exercising vast power over what can be seen and read.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Given the savagery of the Foley video, it's easy in isolation to cheer for its banning on Twitter. But that's always how censorship functions: it invariably starts with the suppression of viewpoints which are so widely hated that the emotional response they produce drowns out any consideration of the principle being endorsed.</p></blockquote>
