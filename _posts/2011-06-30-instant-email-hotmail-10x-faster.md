<p>Caching, prefetching, and asynchronous operations hit the Hotmail web interface, making common email operations up to 10x faster. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2011/06/30/microsoft-claims-10x-hotmail-speed-increase/">The NextWeb</a> goes so far as to say:</p>
<blockquote>
No longer can we chide Hotmail for being horrifically slow. That is now Gmail's bag to carry.</blockquote>
<p>I'm one of the few people on the entire team not working on performance for the last couple of months, but this is a huge win for everybody. If you've got Hotmail, go check it out.</p>
