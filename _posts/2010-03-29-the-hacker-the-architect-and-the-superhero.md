Good article describing three styles of programming that Mike has seen over the course of his career: the hacker who intuitively understands code and its purpose, the architect that designs and organizes for the layman, and the superhero, the one who intuitively handles complexity.

I'm honestly not sure which one I am best described by, because I see aspects of all three in my coding style. More than likely I'd tend toward the hacker style, but mostly 'cause I've never been in a job that allowed me to design a code from scratch.
