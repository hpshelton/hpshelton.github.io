<blockquote>All organisations waste a huge amount of time <i>believing</i> that they are making progress on decisions, when in fact they're just involved in the <i>theatre</i> of decision making. This happens through indirect actions that feel like progress is being made, but in fact contribute nothing to it. Small changes can speed up progress dramatically.</blockquote>
