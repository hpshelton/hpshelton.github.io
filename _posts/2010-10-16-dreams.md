In today's issue of Parker's dreams are totally insane*:

1. I returned to my van (after being mugged?) and found that the back door had been pried open with a crowbar so someone could plant explosives designed to kill me (but not steal my iPod). 

2. I participated in a Discovery channel show on the world's highest-altitude reindeer farm, in the plains hidden at the top of the Himalayas. They had lots of reindeer, and lots of short stubby windmills for some reason. The scene where they airdropped the mail was particularly interesting. 

3. The Kansas City Chiefs catcher made a great play at first base to prevent the Rangers from putting another man on. The leadoff triple off the next pitch bounced off the wall and brought the players on first and second home anyways, leading them to a 6-0 win over the Yankees at Yankee Stadium in the 5th. The fireworks seemed logical than the rest of this.

* I assume they are at least, but I don't normally remember them, much less three in one night.
