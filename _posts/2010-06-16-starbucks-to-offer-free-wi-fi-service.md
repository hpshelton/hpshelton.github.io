<blockquote>Starbucks says that laptop users average an hour of Wi-Fi use in its stores and that it does not expect that to increase significantly.</blockquote>
For those who already pay the fees to browse, I would expect usage to go up somewhat. However, these are already Starbucks cardholders and like their coffee, so I expect Starbucks to benefit from this in general. For those stores near college campuses, however, I expect this to be an issue.
