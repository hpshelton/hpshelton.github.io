<blockquote>A Python program implementing and exploiting the Minsky Turing machine considered in the paper "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02124">Intrinsic Propensity for Vulnerability in Computers? Arbitrary Code Execution in the Universal Turing Machine</a>" as per <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32471">CVE-2021-32471</a>.</blockquote>
<p>Yep, that's right folks. We're finding CVEs in textbook examples of the most basic computers possible.</p>
