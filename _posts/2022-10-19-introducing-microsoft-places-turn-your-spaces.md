<blockquote><p>When spaces have meaning and purpose, they become places. That comes from people gathering, bonding, and sharing an experience together. It's what makes a house a home â€” and an office worth coming into.</p>
<p>Today I'm excited to introduce Microsoft Places, our new connected workplace platform that will reimagine hybrid and in-person work. This platform delivers solutions that coordinate where work happens, modernize the office with intelligent technology, and optimize the workplace for changing needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>They lay the marketing speak on thick for this announcement, but if you assume this vaporware will ship, I could be excited to use something like this. My co-workers and I tend to communicate ad-hoc and naturally choose in-person days with fewer scheduled meetings. It'd be cool to see that happen more automatically while giving management a sense of trends and insight into workplace usage. Hopefully it would also allow our facilities team to stock more Coca-Cola on busier days.</p>
