<p><blockquote>Nobody wants to deliver late, over-budget software. I don't know a single software developer who wakes up in the morning and thinks "I'd like to do a rubbish job today. How can I cost my employer more money?" And yet, so many software projects don't go well. And with every new project, there seems to be more and more pressure to go faster. So, if we're in the business of making software, what do we do? How do we go faster without compromising quality?</blockquote></p>
