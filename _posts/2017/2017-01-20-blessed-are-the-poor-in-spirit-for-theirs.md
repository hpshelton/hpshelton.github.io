<p>"Blessed are the poor in spirit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
Blessed are those who mourn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they will be comforted.<br>
Blessed are the meek,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they will inherit the earth.<br>
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they will be filled.<br>
Blessed are the merciful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they will be shown mercy.<br>
Blessed are the pure in heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they will see God.<br>
Blessed are the peacemakers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they will be called children of God.<br>
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."<br>
<br>
- Matthew 5:3-10</p>
<p>There is perhaps no greater irony than to have these words applied to the person of President Donald Trump during the inauguration. May they transform his heart.</p>
