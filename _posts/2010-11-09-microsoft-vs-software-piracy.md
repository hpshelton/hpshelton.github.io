<blockquote>Microsoft spends "north of $10 million" a year on its intelligence-gathering operations and an estimated $200 million on developing anti-piracy technology.</blockquote>
It also spends about $50 million a year going after counterfeiters. Still just a drop in the bucket compared to a $3 billion <i>quarter</i>. Great article.
