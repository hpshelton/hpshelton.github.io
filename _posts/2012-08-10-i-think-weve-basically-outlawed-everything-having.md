<blockquote>I think we've basically outlawed everything having to do with the world of stuff, and the only thing you're allowed to do is in the world of bits. And that's why we've had a lot of progress in computers and finance. Those were the two areas where there was enormous innovation in the last 40 years. It looks like finance is in the process of getting outlawed. So, the only thing left at this point will be computers and if you're a computer that's good.</blockquote>

 â€” Peter Thiel, <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/07/17/transcript-schmidt-thiel/">Fortune Brainstorm Tech</a>

<p>Thiel makes a lot of interesting points about how technological progress seems to be diminishing and how existing tech giants stockpiling cash is likely a sign that they see no major shifts coming in which to invest at a better return. Also interesting is that Amazon is called out as one of the few companies that breaks this stereotype as they invest in more automation, faster delivery, and move into integrated content and devices.</p>
