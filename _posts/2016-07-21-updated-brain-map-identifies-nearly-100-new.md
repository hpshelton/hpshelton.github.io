<blockquote>In the late 1800s, a group of German researchers identified other regions of the cortex, each having distinct types of cells packed together in unique ways. In 1907, Korbinian Brodmann published a catalog of 52 brain regions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On Wednesday, in what many experts are calling a milestone in neuroscience, researchers published a spectacular new map of the brain, detailing nearly 100 previously unknown regions â€” an unprecedented glimpse into the machinery of the human mind.</blockquote>

<p>Seems like quite an upgrade. Exciting.</p>
