<blockquote><p>Your personal integrity matters. It matters almost more than anything else in the world, for if you lose yourself you've lost your ability to bring value to your relationships and work. Never let someone lead you away from your integrity; not for money, not for experience, not for affirmation. If your integrity has a price, you never had it to begin with.</p>
<p>If you want to build something worthwhile, it must be built upon integrity. If you seek to build something by sidestepping integrity, ask yourself: just what is it you're building?</p></blockquote>
