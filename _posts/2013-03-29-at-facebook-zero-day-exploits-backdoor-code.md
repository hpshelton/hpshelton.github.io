<p>This is only a test. But it's not a test:</p>

<blockquote><div>The engineer's computer was compromised using a real zero-day exploit targeting an undisclosed piece of software. It allowed a "red team" composed of current and former Facebook employees to access the company's code production environment. The PHP code on the Facebook site contained a real backdoor.</div></blockquote>
