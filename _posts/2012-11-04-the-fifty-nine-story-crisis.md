<p>A New Yorker article from 1995 about New York City, skyscrapers, and hurricanes back in 1978.</p>
<blockquote>In 1978, structural engineer William LeMessurier discovered a mistake in his design for the Citicorp Center (the Citigroup Center these days) that put it in extreme danger of collapsing, just as hurricane season was approaching.</blockquote>
