<p><blockquote>[...] Don't tell me that there's something uniquely demanding about building yet another fucking startup that dwarfs the accomplishments of <i>The Origin of Species</i> or winning five championship rings. It's bullshit. Extractive, counterproductive bullshit peddled by people who either need a narrative to explain their personal sacrifices and regrets or who are in a position to treat the lives and wellbeing of others like cannon fodder.</blockquote>
