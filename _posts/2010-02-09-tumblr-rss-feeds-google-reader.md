For those technologically astute enough to realize, Google Reader is not playing nice with the RSS feed from my blog. The issue was reported to Tumblr and Google. Google's response:

<blockquote>
Thanks for reporting this. We've discussed the issue with the appropriate Tumblr engineers* and we hope to have a solution this week. In the mean time, a refresh (with the feed select use the "Refresh" button) should fix the problem (it's a transient issue that goes away once we're able to re-fetch the feed).<br>

* actually, it was Superfeedr engineers, since they handle some feed-related functionality for Tumblr.<br>

Super quick reply, and an easy fix. Hopefully it gets permanently fixed soon.
