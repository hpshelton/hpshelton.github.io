<blockquote>Today, all our wives and husbands have Blackberries or iPhones or Android devices or whatever--the progeny of those original 950 and 957 models that put data in our pockets. Now we all check our email (or Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, or...) compulsively at the dinner table, or the traffic light. Now we all stow our devices on the nightstand before bed, and check them first thing in the morning. We all do. It's not abnormal, and it's not just for business. It's just what people do. Like smoking in 1965, it's just life.</blockquote>
<p>Mobile technology has replaced smoking as the social tic, changing societal interaction and our sense of connectedness. I really like the analogy, but it's interesting to note that smoking is often a social activity where technological interaction is often a means of escape.</p>
