<blockquote>An analysis of the survival rate shows that, in contrast to the Titanic, the crew generally does the best, and children the worst. Women started out doing pretty poorly, but their survival have been going up as the years have passed. But before we conclude that chivalry was dead and seeing a revival, we'll caution you that it may be just that more women now learn how to swim.</blockquote>
<p>Seems like there's not a lot of chivalry on sinking ships, regardless of whether or not the captain yells 'women and children first'.</p>
