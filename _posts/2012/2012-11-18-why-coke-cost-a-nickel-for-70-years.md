<blockquote><p>In 1886, a bottle of Coke cost a nickel. It was also a nickel in 1900, 1915 and 1930. In fact, 70 years after the first Coke was sold, you could still buy a bottle for a nickel.</p>
<p>Three wars, the Great Depression, hundreds of competitors â€” none of it made any difference for the price of Coke. Why not?</p>
