<p><a href="http://theroseiswhite.com/">The Rose Is White</a> is fantastic for having been planned, filmed, and edited in 62 hours.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the judges, Mike Knoll, had this to say about the film:</p>
<p>In the four years I've been judging the contest, no film has affected me as much as The Rose is White, It was powerful, technically stunning. The fact this team put together such a tight and refined film in such a short period of time is an artistic and technical achievement.</p>
