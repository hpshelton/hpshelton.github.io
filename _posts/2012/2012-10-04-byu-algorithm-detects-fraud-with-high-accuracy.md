<blockquote>Researchers from Brigham Young University have helped create the most robust and accurate fraud detection system to date using information from publicly available financial statements.</blockquote>
<p>Very little detail on the method itself, but there's no reason to assume that with the amount of financial data that's now publicly available, they couldn't do what they're purporting to do. Unless the MetaFraud team is defrauding people, which would be meta-MetaFraud?</p>
