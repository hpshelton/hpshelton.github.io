<blockquote>Even though only interactions between pairs of starlings were included in the model, it was sufficient to give rise to strong correlations in the flight between larger numbers of starlings. It suggests that an entire flock may move as a unit, even though birds do not "communicate" across wide distances. This effect is independent of how tightly packed the flock is, something known as a <i>topological order</i>: it only matters that the birds <i>have</i> neighbors, not how close those neighbors are.</blockquote>
