<blockquote>Surprisingly, while rhythm is quite regular, it turns out that it is not as predictable as we might have expected. [...] If you look at the timing of musical notes, they are not as regularly spaced as we might expect and in fact have a certain fractal structure as well. Using a large collection of music that spans centuries, the researchers find that musical rhythm obeys a 1/f pattern, with different types of music being able to fit to this power law (though varying in the exponent of the power law).</blockquote>
