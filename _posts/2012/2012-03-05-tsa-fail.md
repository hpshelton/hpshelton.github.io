<blockquote>TSA has spent approximately $60 billion since 2002 and now has over 65,000 employees, more than the Department of State, more than the Department of Energy, more than the Department of Labor, more than the Department of Education, and more than the Department of Housing and Urban Development - <i>combined</i>. TSA has become, according to [a government] report, "an enormous, inflexible and distracted bureaucracy more concerned with……consolidating power."</blockquote>
