<blockquote>In San Francisco you'll need to work 20.6 years at the local average wage of $1,478 per week in order to save enough for a 20 percent down payment on a typical 2,000 square-foot home. That's more than anywhere else in the country except Honolulu, where housing prices are high but wages are much lower.</blockquote>
