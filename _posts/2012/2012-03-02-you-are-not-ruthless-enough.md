<blockquote><p>It's not just temporary. Now that it works you're not going to touch it because something else depends on that behavior and touching it will be far too risky. You're probably not going to clean it up, except perhaps to put it under the bed and hope no one trips over it later.</p><p>Even on a tight schedule, last-minute block-ship bugs appear and what should have been a simple, straightforward bug fix will turn into some Giger-esque state-driven nightmare causing everyone associated with the project to invent new profanities because the ones they have don't seem emphatic enough.</p></blockquote>
