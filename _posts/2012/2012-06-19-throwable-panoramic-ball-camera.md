<p>I'm not really that impressed, because, as it says, it's just a throwable ball with cameras that takes panoramic pictures. But it's certainly a clever idea, similar to the <a href="http://hpshelton.acm.jhu.edu/video/HankWillisThomas/Farmer's Market 2-desktop.m4v">360 degree video format (66MB)</a> we made at the Digital Media Center with Hank Willis Thomas when he was an artist-in-residence.</p>
