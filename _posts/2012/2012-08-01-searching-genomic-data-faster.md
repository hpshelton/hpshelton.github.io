<blockquote>In the latest issue of Nature Biotechnology, MIT and Harvard University researchers describe a new algorithm that drastically reduces the time it takes to find a particular gene sequence in a database of genomes. Moreover, the more genomes it's searching, the greater the speedup it affords, so its advantages will only compound as more data is generated.</blockquote>

<p>The new algorithm is anywhere between 2 and 4 times faster than BLAST in initial trials, increasing at a rate proportional to the unique elements of each sequence, with an accuracy of 96%. This is a huge breakthrough for genomics, but possibly also for other applications in big data in which comparison between elements with lots of similarity are required, as the researchers have built a system that indexes directly on the compressed data.</p>
