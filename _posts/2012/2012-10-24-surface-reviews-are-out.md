<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/microsofts-first-stab-at-a-pc-surface-reviewed/">Ars Technica </a>and <a href="http://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/10/microsoft-surface/all/">Wired</a> have well-balanced reviews of the Surface. It competes with the iPad in some places and beats Android in most, but does silly Windows RT things in others. The hardware looks to be much better than the software at the moment.</p>
