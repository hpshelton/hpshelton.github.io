<blockquote>We, the people, have the means to eliminate laws we find noxious through our elected officials. Many have hoped that the Supreme Court would rule the mandate unconstitutional because they have little faith in Congress's — our elected officials — ability to get anything of any importance at all done, and I have little doubt many of those people are angry with the Court's decision today. But that is not the Court's concern, nor their role. Their job is not to take up slack when our elected officials are shirking their duties, and it is not only unfair, but counter to our system of government, to expect the Court to do so.</blockquote>
