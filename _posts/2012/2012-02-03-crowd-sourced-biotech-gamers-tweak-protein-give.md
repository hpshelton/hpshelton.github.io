<blockquote>Until recently, all FoldIt players have been asked to do is figure out how existing proteins fold. That has now changed; the people behind the FoldIt project have added tools that allow players to engineer new variants of an old protein. Once again, the gamers have come through, figuring out changes that dramatically improve the protein's activity.</blockquote>
