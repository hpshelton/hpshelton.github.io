<blockquote><p>I've hiked or backpacked three of the four canyons featured in Metron's (no name given) film, <a href="http://vimeo.com/13888708">Journey Through Canyons</a>. Surprisingly, the Grand Canyon is the only one I've not seen in person.</p>

<p>Be sure to check the Flickr photoset showing the DSLR gear used to create the film: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vmetron/sets/72157624654296344/with/4860573917/">Canyons, Making Of</a>.</p></blockquote>

I neither had the time, the equipment, or the expertise to do this, nor was the weather particularly forgiving enough in my time at the canyons. But this gives you a rough idea of what I saw. I hiked at least one of the same trials.

P.S. On a unrelated note, I continue to experience problems with Vimeo on every video in every browser using either Flash or HTML5, with the exception of Safari's HTML5. Super frustrating for a "professional" site.
