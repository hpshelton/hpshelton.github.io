<blockquote>The HTML5 Labs site is the place where Microsoft prototypes early and unstable web standard specifications from standards bodies such as the W3C. Sharing these prototypes helps us have informed discussions with developer communities, and contributes to a better implementation experience with draft specifications.</blockquote>

This goes a long way to reassuring me that faster iterations will be the case with IE 9+.
