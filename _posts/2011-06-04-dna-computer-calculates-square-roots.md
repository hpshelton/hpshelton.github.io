<blockquote>The work, reported in Science, required 130 strands of DNA to work in a cascade of programmed chemical changes.</blockquote>

This result far surpasses any other published calculations or previous complexity. Reportedly, the system is also capable of mimicing the capability of a debugger or compiler.
