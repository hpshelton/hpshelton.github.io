<blockquote>Today at the National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, researchers from MIT's Nocera Lab, led by Dr. Daniel Nocera, claimed that they've created an artificial leaf made from stable and--more importantly--inexpensive materials.</blockquote>
They claim it performs photosynthesis 10 times more efficiently than the real thing.
