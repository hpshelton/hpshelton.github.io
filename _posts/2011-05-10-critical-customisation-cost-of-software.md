<blockquote>I've noticed a further manifestation of this compulsive behavior as regards installing software on my machines, and I've called it the Critical Customisation Cost (CCC, henceforth) of software. Put simply, there's a cost (not just financial, but rather psychological and emotional) associated with installing third-party software on a computing device, and there's an associated threshold above which the CCC is so high that it outweighs the benefit of the functionality offered by the software.</blockquote>

His list of symptoms fits me to a T, among them:
<blockquote><ul><li>Balking at an app because its menubar (status bar) icon isn't monochrome, or generally homogeneous with the system-supplied icons (or, even worse, is confusingly similar to one of the standard ones).</li>
<li>Returning to one of the factory-installed desktop wallpapers after only briefly trying a custom one, and repeating this process every two months.</li></ul></blockquote>
