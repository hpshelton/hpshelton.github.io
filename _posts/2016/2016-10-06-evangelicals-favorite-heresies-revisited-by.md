<p><blockquote>This year's study showed similar results, indicating that not only are those who self-identify as evangelical confused about the basic tenets of their faith, but so are those who fit the National Association of Evangelicals's definition of evangelicals based on their stated beliefs.</blockquote>
<p>Given that "a quarter of evangelicals believe that 'there is little value' in 'studying or reciting historical Christian creeds and confessions'", it seems obvious why many were unable to answer basic questions about their faith. I present The Creeds for your edification, evangelicals:</p>

<h2>The Nicene Creed</h2>
<br><p>
We believe in one God,<br>
the Father, the Almighty,<br>
maker of heaven and earth,<br>
of all that is, seen and unseen.<br>
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>
the only Son of God,<br>
eternally begotten of the Father,<br>
God from God, Light from Light,<br>
true God from true God,<br>
begotten, not made,<br>
of one Being with the Father.<br>
Through him all things were made.<br>
For us and for our salvation<br>
he came down from heaven:<br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,<br>
and was made man.<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>
he suffered death and was buried.<br>
On the third day he rose again<br>
in accordance with the Scriptures;<br>
he ascended into heaven<br>
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,<br>
and his kingdom will have no end.</p>

<p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,<br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.<br>
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>
and the life of the world to come. Amen.
</p>
<br><h2>The Apostles' Creed</h2><br><p>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.</p>

<p>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>

<p>I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic Church; the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen.</p></p>
