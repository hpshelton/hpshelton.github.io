<p>Really, Bloomberg? 'Cause your site makes 141 HTTP connections for 6.8 MB of data and Ghostery cuts down the time it takes to load from 19.2 to 15.6 seconds with DomContentLoaded dropping by 8.6 seconds in my totally unscientific, inaccurate web performance test. Maybe check with your experts before posting web performance tips. And lose some page weight while you're talking to those experts. I'm not whitelisting Wired, I'm not whitelisting Forbes, and I'm not whitelisting you.</p>
