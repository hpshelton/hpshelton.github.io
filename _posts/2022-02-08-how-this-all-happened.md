<blockquote><p>This is a short story about what happened to the U.S. economy since the end of World War II.</p>

<p>That's a lot to unpack in 5,000 words, but the short story of what happened over the last 73 years is simple: Things were very uncertain, then they were very good, then pretty bad, then really good, then really bad, and now here we are. And there is, I think, a narrative that links all those events together. Not a detailed account. But a story of how the details fit together.</p></blockquote>
