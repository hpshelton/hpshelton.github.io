<blockquote>An email has been going around the internet as a part of a release of documents related to Apple's App Store-based suit brought by Epic Games. I love this email for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that you can extrapolate from it the very reasons Apple has remained such a vital force in the industry for the past decade.</blockquote>
