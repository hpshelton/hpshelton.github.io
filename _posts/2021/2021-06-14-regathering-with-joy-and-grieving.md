<blockquote><p>I felt like I was back in school recently, listening to a conversation with Rick Warren, author of The Purpose Driven Life. While recognizing the excitement of gathering onsite to worship, he said that one of the biggest adjustments will be to the far greater need for care and support. "I don't think we yet realize how hard this has been for people, whether they are in the heart of the congregation or just walk by our churches," he said. "People will be looking for places that listen to their pain and confusion, who offer compassion without pat answers, and offer real community."</p>

<p>Mixed in with the joy of worship and familiar faces will be the tears and fears of all we have gone through. It will be like the people gathering at the rebuilt temple in the time of Ezra. Some were thrilled to be back, while others grieved all that had been suffered. "Many of the older priests and families, who had seen the first temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of the new temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy. It was so loud no one could distinguish the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping. And the sound was heard far away." (Ezra 3:12-13) </p></blockquote>

<p>While thinking about regathering with others in our church community, these words from Pastors John Crosby and Rick Warren have resonated. What we're coming back to isn't the same that we left. There is no "normal" to return to as everyone has been changed in some way. I pray that our church communities can be good stewards of both joy and pain as we move forward into the new work God is doing.</p>
