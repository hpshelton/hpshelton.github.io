They extracted from the floor of Italy's Pozzuoili Bay, in the northern tip of the Bay of Naples, a sample of concrete that dates back to 37 B.C. and analyzed its mineral components at research labs in Europe and the U.S. The analysis, the scientists believe, reveals the lost recipe of Roman concrete.</blockquote>
