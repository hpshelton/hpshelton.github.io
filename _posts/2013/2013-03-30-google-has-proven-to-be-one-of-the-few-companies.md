<blockquote>Google has proven to be one of the few companies capable of creating, popularizing, and supporting a platform. ... This power can only be negated by another company that's willing and able to match Google's Android efforts on all fronts: OS development, app store, developer tools, evangelism, the works. That's a tall order.</blockquote>
