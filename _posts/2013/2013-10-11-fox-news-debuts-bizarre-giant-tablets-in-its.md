<blockquote>In a video that could be mistaken for a <em>College Humor</em> or <em>Saturday Night Live</em> parody, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith walks viewers through the network's new setup, which includes workstations with 55-inch touchscreen monitors. In the video, journalists swipe through pages and apps, presumably collecting information for live reporting.</blockquote>
