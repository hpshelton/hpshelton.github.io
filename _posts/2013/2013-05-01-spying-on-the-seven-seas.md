<p>More from the annals of "Scary Security Stuff Found by the Internet":</p><blockquote><p>On the Internet you can find websites that provide vessel tracking data based either on asking people to volunteer the information from their AIS receivers or deploying some themselves. However, we observed AIS receivers that are blatantly open on the Internet, many belonging to private organizations and institutions.</p><p>Considering that a lot of military, law enforcement, cargo, and passenger ships broadcast their positions, we feel that this is a security risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>People doing stupid things on the open Internet could be a security risk? You don't say.</p>
