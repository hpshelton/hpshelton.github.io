<blockquote>
<p>Physicists have discovered a jewel-like geometric object that dramatically simplifies calculations of particle interactions and challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental components of reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The degree of efficiency is mind-boggling,&rdquo; said Jacob Bourjaily, a theoretical physicist at Harvard University and one of the researchers who developed the new idea. &ldquo;You can easily do, on paper, computations that were infeasible even with a computer before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don't know enough about multi-dimensional geometry or particle physics to understand the exact impact of this discovery, but this article is a fantastic high-level look at why science believes the amplituhedron is important.</p>
