<blockquote>When software testing began, it was essentially for scientific endeavors. It should be of no surprise to find that [the discipline] grew from debugging as a mechanism to "prove" correctness of a program (i.e., prove it works). This then grew to finding bugs. However, I believe as commercialized software began to dominate, making it "user friendly" became a differentiator for most businesses. Suddenly "correctness" meant quality and we hired hoards of testers to pound and find bugs.</blockquote>

<p>Correctness can be ascertained via unit tests, data analysis, proofs, and white box testing, and probably a few other techniques thrown in there. What we focus on in automation is continued determination of a program's correctness. But this is indeed separate from quality, which can only be proven negatively, not positively. The number of bugs found in an area is a useless metric; the number of bugs users experience is the most important.</p>
