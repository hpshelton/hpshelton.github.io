<blockquote>Just as the reduction of art to political propaganda leads to bad art, the aestheticization of politics leads to bad, irresponsible politics. Thatâ€™s because aesthetics and politics are not the same thing. They are not totally unrelated, obviously, but they are also and even primarily <i>different</i>. A political message can be part of an aesthetic effect, just as a political movement <i>can</i> benefit from an aesthetic appeal. But we get nowhere if we confuse or collapse these categories.</blockquote>
