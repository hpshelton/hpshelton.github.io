<blockquote><p>Despite the various iterations of cyber strategies (and the effort of those who worked to create and implement them) over the years, many underlying cyber problems facing the United States today are worse than they were in 1998. Accordingly, something needs to change if the impact of this strategy is going to be any different.</p>
<p>Comparing the new strategy with those of the past decades highlights how U.S. cyber policy has changed and where this strategy most represents continuity or change. The most important topics of comparison are the promise and threats of cyberspace, getting markets to deliver security, partnerships between the public and private sectors, and countering adversaries.</p></blockquote>
