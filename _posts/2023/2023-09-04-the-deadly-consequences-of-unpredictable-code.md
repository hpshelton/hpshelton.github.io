<blockquote>Twenty years ago, George Dyson anticipated much of what is happening today in his classic book <i>Darwin Among the Machines</i>. The problem, he tells me, is that we're building systems that are beyond our intellectual means to control. We believe that if a system is deterministic (acting according to fixed rules, this being the definition of an algorithm) it is predictable â€“ and that what is predictable can be controlled. Both assumptions turn out to be wrong.</blockquote>
