<blockquote><p>A team of computer scientists has come up with a dramatically faster algorithm for one of the oldest problems in computer science: maximum flow. The problem asks how much material can flow through a network from a source to a destination if the links in the network have capacity limits.</p>
<p>The new algorithm is "absurdly fast," said Daniel Spielman of Yale University. "I was actually inclined to believe â€¦ algorithms this good for this problem would not exist."</p></blockquote>
