<blockquote>American artist Alexa Meade creates her representational paintings directly on her subjects, covering people and objects in layers of acrylic paint before photographing them. The works offer an unusual conflation of painting, installation, and photography, as the three-dimensional forms are collapsed in space, taking on a 2D appearance in the prints. In her exhibitions, Meade frequently paints over small rooms in which a human subject sits for the duration of the show, offering a performative aspect to her work.</blockquote>
