<blockquote>In a paper to be presented at the Association for Computing Machinery's Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computing in May, [the researchers] demonstrate a new analytic technique suggesting that, in a wide range of real-world cases, lock-free algorithms actually give wait-free performance.</blockquote>
<p>The easy, simple parallel programming algorithms don't appear to behave much worse than the complicated ones in practice.</p>
