<blockquote><p>[W]hen we do talk about power, we often talk about it strictly as something negative—something dangerous to be avoided—rather than as a gift to be stewarded. [...]</p>
<p>If power is irredeemably negative, none of us would want to admit we have it—which means none of us will be accountable for the power we have. [...]</p>
<p>But if power is a gift, then we can be accountable for its proper use—to its Giver, and to one another.</p></blockquote>
