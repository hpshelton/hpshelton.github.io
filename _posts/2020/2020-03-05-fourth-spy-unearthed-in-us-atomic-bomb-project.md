<blockquote>
<p>The world's first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, in the New Mexican desert â€” a result of a highly secretive effort code-named the Manhattan Project, whose nerve center lay nearby in Los Alamos. Just 49 months later, the Soviets detonated a nearly identical device in Central Asia, and Washington's monopoly on nuclear arms abruptly ended.</p>
<p>How Moscow managed to make such quick progress has long fascinated scientists, federal agents and historians. The work of three spies eventually came to light. Now atomic sleuths have found a fourth. Oscar Seborer, like the other spies, worked at wartime Los Alamos, a remote site ringed by tall fences and armed guards. Mr. Seborer nonetheless managed to pass sensitive information about the design of the American weapon to Soviet agents.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>His role "has remained hidden for 70 years," write Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes in the current issue of <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies">Studies in Intelligence</a>, the C.I.A.'s in-house journal; <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-63-no-3/pdfs/Fourth-Soviet-Spy-LosAlamos.pdf">their article</a> is titled "On the Trail of a Fourth Soviet Spy at Los Alamos."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It got better two months later as it was learned that the spy, Oscar Seborer, had the most intimate working knowledge of the American bomb's construction of all the spies. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/science/manhattan-project-nuclear-spy.html">He worked on the explosive trigger mechanism.</a> His codename? Godsend.</p>
