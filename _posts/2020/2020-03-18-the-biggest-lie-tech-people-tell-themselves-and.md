<blockquote><p>Technologists' desire to make a parallel to evolution is flawed at its very foundation. Evolution is driven by random mutation — mistakes, not plans. […] Evolution doesn't have meetings about the market, the environment, the customer base. Evolution doesn't patent things or do focus groups. Evolution doesn't spend millions of dollars lobbying Congress to ensure that its plans go unfettered.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not all technology is neutral and it's worth considering the ramifications of our choices rather than arguing that progress is the natural state of things. All these decisions are made with an intent, but they should be with intentionality.</p>
