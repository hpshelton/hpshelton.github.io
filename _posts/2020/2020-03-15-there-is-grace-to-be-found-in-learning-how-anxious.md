<blockquote>There is grace to be found in learning how anxious and afraid we actually are. It is a grace to learn how much of a jerk we can be to our neighbors when we fight over toilet paper and hand sanitizer. It is a grace for those that have been overreactive and also for those who have brushed it all off as not-serious. The worst being brought out of each of us can be exactly what reveals our need for Jesus — the one person who really does save us from ourselves.</blockquote>
