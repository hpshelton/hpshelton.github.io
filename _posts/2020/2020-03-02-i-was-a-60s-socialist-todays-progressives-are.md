<p><blockquote>For the foreseeable future, though, if the left wants to create the political majority [â€¦], it will have to frame its positions in a vernacular that most Americans can understand. It will also have to draw a sharp distinction between the positions it deems essential for "big, structural change" and those that can be delegated to communities to calibrate and debate. The new left of the '60s failed in this mission. We didn't just dream big; we ascended into the realm of fantasy and visible sainthood. Today's left will need to learn from our mistakes.</blockquote>

<p>Failing to moderate and propose practical, bipartisan policies will mean the left's coalition will be unable to effectively wield political influence.</p></p>
