<blockquote>Tell us a few details about you and we'll guess which political party you belong to. It shouldn't be that simple, right? We're all complex people with a multiplicity of identities and values. But the reality is that in America today, how you answer a handful of questions is very likely to determine how you vote.</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of how you vote, make sure you vote. Super Tuesday is next week! If you don't know if or how you can vote, start at https://vote.gov.</p>
