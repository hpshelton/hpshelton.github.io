<p>The root word for "spiritual" has changed through the various ages, from translation from Hebrew (<i>ruwach</i>) to Greek (<i>pneuma</i>) to Latin (<i>spiritus</i>):</p> 
<blockquote>Even though the root concept of spirituality is rooted in the wind — God's breath, the physical manifestations of God's interactions with the elements of earth — the word has come to mean exactly the opposite of physical.</blockquote>
<p>But,</p>
<blockquote>Ancient spirituality was physical. God was <i>not</i> yet this immortal, invisible, inconceivable mystery: God could walk in a garden. God could be a pillar of fire, real fire. God could talk in a cloud. God had two hands. God had breath.</blockquote>
<p>And He <i>has</i> breath. Breath that gives life, words that restore it, and love that redeems it.</p>
