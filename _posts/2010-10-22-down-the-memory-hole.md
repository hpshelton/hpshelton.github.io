<blockquote>
<p>It appears that Apple is deliberately attempting to usurp the meaning of the word Flash in the computing industry and redefine it. They're tired of the word standing for an inefficient browser plugin. They've begun leaving Flash out of stock Mac OS X installs. They're dodging its implied meaning in calls and pushing what they want it to refer to. Fast, efficient storage.</p></blockquote>

Noticed that too, did you, Jeff?
