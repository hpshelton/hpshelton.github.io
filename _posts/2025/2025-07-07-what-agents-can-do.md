<blockquote><p>There’s a lot of excitement about what AI (specifically the latest wave of LLM-anchored AI) can do, and how AI-first companies are different from the prior generations of companies. There are a lot of important and real opportunities at hand, but I find that many of these conversations occur at such an abstract altitude that they border on meaningless. Sort of like saying that your company could be much better if you merely adopted _more software_. That’s certainly true, but it’s not a particularly helpful claim.</p>
