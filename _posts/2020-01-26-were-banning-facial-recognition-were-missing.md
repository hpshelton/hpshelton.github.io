<blockquote><p>The whole purpose of this process is for companies — and governments — to treat individuals differently. We are shown different ads on the internet and receive different offers for credit cards. Smart billboards display different advertisements based on who we are. In the future, we might be treated differently when we walk into a store, just as we currently are when we visit websites.</p>
<p>The point is that it doesn't matter which technology is used to identify people. [...] And most of the time, it doesn't matter if identification isn't tied to a real name. What's important is that we can be consistently identified over time.</p></blockquote>
