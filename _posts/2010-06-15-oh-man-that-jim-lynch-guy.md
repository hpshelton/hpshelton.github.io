<blockquote>Here's what Jim [Lynch] and the rest don't seem to realise. Revenue from Adsense and its ilk is a reward for writing content that made people want to visit your website and grant you a pageview. If you do it really well, you'll get a bunch of pageviews, and a bunch of money. Employing tricks like needless pagination, auto-refreshing (see Salon.com), misleading headlines, and the like is cheating. You didn't earn those pageviews, you tricked people into giving them to you.</blockquote>
