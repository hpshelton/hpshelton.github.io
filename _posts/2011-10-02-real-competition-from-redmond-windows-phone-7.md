<blockquote>With Mango, Microsoft has got the smartphone operating system right. It's fast, it's fun, it's easy to use, it does everything you need, and it looks great. It takes the things that made the original release unique and makes them better, and it addresses nearly every criticism made of that version. As a piece of software, it's a triumph, and it's more than good enough to take on Android and iOS.</blockquote>
