<p>Facebook responds to the tracking allegations with comments to the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote>Facebook on Monday defended its practice of gathering data from "Like" buttons even after users have logged out, saying that the collection is part of a system to prevent improper logins and that the information is quickly deleted.</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like no one's denying this is actually true.</p>
<blockquote><p>Arturo Bejar, a Facebook director of engineering, said that the data is required to prevent spam and phishing attacks and to help keep users from having to go through extra authentication steps every time they log in.</p><p>"The onus is on us is to take all the data and scrub it," said Bejar. "What really matters is what we say as a company and back it up."</p></blockquote>
<p>That's funny, Facebook. I really don't trust what you say.</p>
