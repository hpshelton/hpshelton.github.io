I like Seth Godin's blog post a lot, but unfortunately, you don't ship too much software as a college student. So, I'm going to change it and simply list most of the things I did. There are a few accomplishments thrown in, too.

</ul>
Not a bad year at all. Unfortunately, there is also a list of things I didn't get done in 2010, but it's much shorter. And I've got all of 2011 to do it in.<br>
<br>
Happy New Year's, everyone!
