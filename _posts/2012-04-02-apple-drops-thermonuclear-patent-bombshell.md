<blockquote>"When we sued Samsung in April of last year," Apple's SVP and general counsel Bruce Sewell told us, "one of our assertions was that that company had modified its original design to include 'square icons with rounded corners' that were copied directly from our iOS icons. How much of a legal leap is it from the assertion of owning squares with rounded corners to asserting that we own the rectangle?"</blockquote>
