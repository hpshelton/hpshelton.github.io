<p><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/former-nsa-staffers-rogue-insider-shadow-brokers-theory">Motherboard</a> is citing former NSA staffers who are convinced another insider smuggled the weapons out of an air-gapped system, while <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/08/19/the-nsa-was-hacked-snowden-documents-confirm/">The Intercept</a> has definitively tied the malware to the NSA. Pretty much a worst-case scenario for the agency.</p>
<p>I certainly may not like how the NSA knowingly chooses to target Americans' data, but I agree without reservation with their mandate for digital intelligence-gathering against foreign actors. I don't want their methods exposed nor their digital nuclear weapons available to those enemies. I respect Snowden's reponsible disclosure; this is reprehensible.</p>
