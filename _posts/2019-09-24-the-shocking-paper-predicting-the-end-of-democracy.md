<blockquote><p>Democracy is hard work. And as society's "elites" — experts and public figures who help those around them navigate the heavy responsibilities that come with self-rule — have increasingly been sidelined, citizens have proved ill equipped cognitively and emotionally to run a well-functioning democracy. As a consequence, the center has collapsed and millions of frustrated and angst-filled voters have turned in desperation to right-wing populists.</p>

<p>[Rosenburg's] prediction? "In well-established democracies like the United States, democratic governance will continue its inexorable decline and will eventually fail."<p></blockquote>
