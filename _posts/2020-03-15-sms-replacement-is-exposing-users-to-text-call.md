<blockquote><p>The Rich Communication Services (RCS) standard is essentially the replacement for SMS. The news shows how even as carriers move onto more modern protocols for communication, phone network security continues to be an exposed area with multiple avenues for attack in some implementations of RCS.</p>
<p>SRLabs didn't find an issue in the RCS standard itself, but rather how it is being implemented by different telecos. [...] "Everybody seems to get it wrong right now, but in different ways."</p></blockquote>
<p>Shocked, shocked I say.</p>
