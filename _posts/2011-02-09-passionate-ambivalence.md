<blockquote>I'm passionately ambivalent about technology. My excitement about where things are going is balanced equally by my anxiety. That might sound awfully unpleasant, but it's a powerful feeling. The more I think about technology – the more I focus in on the contradictions – the more ambivalent I become. I've got no philosophy to sell, nothing to argue. I'm just here to think, and write, and dig deeper.</blockquote>

Connor O'Brien hits about as close to my philosophy as I've ever read. I'm passionate about technology, concerned about how it's affecting society. I'm ambivalent about the latest specs or gadget, only curious as to whether or not it makes life <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/better">better</a>, that is, more purposeful, more beautiful, or <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2011/02/02/the_noise.html">less noisy</a>, not necessarily easier.
