<p><blockquote>"Yes, overall having a youth pastor is a net positive. However, those positive elements can be undercut when we imagine that the youth pastor is the "youths' pastor." Instead, it is the job of the youth pastor to be pastoring the whole congregation with the particular job of advocating, listening to, and connecting young people with others in the congregation."</blockquote></p>
