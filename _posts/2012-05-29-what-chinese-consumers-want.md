<blockquote>China is a Confucian society, a quixotic combination of top-down patriarchy and bottom-up social mobility. Citizens are driven by an ever-present conflict between standing out and fitting in, between ambition and regimentation.

Western individualism—the idea of defining oneself independent of society—doesn't exist.</blockquote>
