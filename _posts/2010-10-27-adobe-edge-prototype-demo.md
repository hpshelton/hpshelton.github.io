<blockquote><p>Now this is more like it Adobe, a demo of a new HTML5 animation editor.</p>

<p>Looks impressive but from the demo the UI appears to be Air or similar to the Flash parts of the Flash IDE, judging from the dodgy tooltips and font rendering. Now thats perfectly fine for a prototype, but from my experiences with the non-native elements of the Flash UI and the Fireworks UI are horrible to work in.</p></blockquote>

Looks like they're finally almost kinda-sorta getting it. I did have a sudden chill go down my spine at the thought of the HTML/CSS/JS output it'll generate, though.
