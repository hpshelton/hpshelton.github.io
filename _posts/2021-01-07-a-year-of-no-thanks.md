<blockquote><p>[The verse] does not say, as Schweitzer misquoted, and as many people seem to think, "<i>For</i> all things, give thanks." Gratitude is not about giving thanks <i>for</i> anything that is evil or unjust. Never <i>for</i> violence, lying, oppression, and suffering. Not <i>for</i> illness, hunger, or abuse. Do not be grateful <i>for</i> these things.</p>

<p>The verse says, "Give thanks <i>in</i> all circumstances." That little Greek word, "en" means <i>in</i>, <i>with</i>, <i>within</i>, and <i>throughout</i>. It locates us, <i>in</i> the here and now. <i>In</i> the past, <i>in</i> the future. <i>In</i> happiness, <i>in</i> despair. <i>In</i> all things. <i>In</i> all times. <i>In</i> all situations.</p>

<p>We shouldn't be grateful <i>for</i> COVID, <i>for</i> the political chaos, <i>for</i> the broken climate, <i>for</i> economic suffering. But we can be grateful <i>through</i> these times, while we are struggling <i>in</i> them. </p></blockquote>
