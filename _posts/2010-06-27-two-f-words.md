<blockquote>I think Satan wants us to think our past is fixable. God wants us to know our past is forgivable.</blockquote>

This fits very well with the message at church this morning on forgiveness. Is our inability to forgive God, ourselves, and others caused by doubt, guilt, grudges, regret or fear?
