Republican senator Jeff Flake: 

<blockquote>It was we conservatives who rightly and robustly asserted our constitutional prerogatives as a co-equal branch of government when a Democrat was in the White House but who, despite solemn vows to do the same in the event of a Trump presidency, have maintained an unnerving silence as instability has ensued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If ultimately our principles were so malleable as to no longer be principles, then what was the point of political victories in the first place?</blockquote>
