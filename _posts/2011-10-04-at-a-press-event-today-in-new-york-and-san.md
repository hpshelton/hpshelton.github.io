<p>At a press event today in New York and San Francisco, we announced and previewed a selection of new Windows Live Hotmail features that will be rolling out to users in the coming month, including better tools for managing newsletters like unsubscribe and scheduled inbox cleanup, improvements to flagging, custom categories for filters and quickviews, a new Android app with full email, contact, and calendar syncing, and my favorite, instant actions that appear when hovering over messages. The <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2011/10/03/hotmail-declares-war-on-graymail.aspx">official blog post</a> has details a few of these, <a href="http://www.winrumors.com/hotmail-updated-to-include-gmail-like-tagging-and-more-outlook-features/">WinRumors has a writeup</a> with some other details and screenshots, and <a href="http://anotherlookathotmail.com">http://anotherlookathotmail.com</a> has video of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowslive/anotherlookathotmail/upcoming-features/">new features</a> in action along with facts and stats, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowslive/anotherlookathotmail/performance/">performance numbers</a>, info on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowslive/anotherlookathotmail/security/">security</a>, and why you should give Hotmail another look.</p>
