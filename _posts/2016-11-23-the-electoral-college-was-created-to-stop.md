<p><blockquote>Consider what Alexander Hamilton wrote in <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp">Federalist Paper Number 68</a>. The Electors were supposed to stop a candidate with "Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity" from becoming President.</blockquote></p>
