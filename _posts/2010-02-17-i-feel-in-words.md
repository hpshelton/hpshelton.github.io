<blockquote>i feel in words.  i feel in art, photos, and film, but mostly, i feel in words.  i love the duality of patterning that gives words their meaning, the extra layers of meaning conjured by the hand, the pen, the keys of the gifted artist.  words are art.  words are abstract, creative, sure, and concrete.  words are ever-changing, but have such a sense of constancy that they can soothe our hurts or inflame our tempers.  words can drive away and words can bring together. words can confound.  words can bring enlightenment.<br><br>
i love words and their building blocks.  i love the phonemes and allophones.  i love the morphemes and allomorphs.  i love the denotative and connotative meaning.  i love words that give direction.  i love the words to a song sung over the downtrodden and depressed.  i love the power of the spoken and written.<br><br>
i love the Word.  i love the One who clothed Himself in the allophone of our condition, and took on the shame of our misplaced morphemes.  i love the Word who made Himself understood.  i love the One whose shift of register shattered the cultural connotations of grace, mercy, and love.  i love the Word who is Love.  i love the ability to express that He gives.  i love that He created.  i love that the way i put together words and learned how to use them in language speaks to a Universality outside of humanity that spoke into being my speech and your speech.  i love His meaning.  His absolute, universal, transcendent meaning.  i love that He redefines everything.<br><br>
i love the Word.  i. love. Jesus.</blockquote>
