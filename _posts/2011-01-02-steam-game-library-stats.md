<p>I was prompted by a conversation with a friend this weekend to take a look at my Steam game library and whip up some stats. The handy <a href="http://www.steamcalculator.com/">Steam Calculator</a> says that I have 77 games with a (current) retail value of $1098.18. That does not, however, tell the whole story. This ugly Excel chart was generated with the help of my Steam receipts:</p>
<div style="text-align:center; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="367" data-orig-width="500"><img src="/assets/images/9437f2b65417f0418078a1cfe088392e9e9bfc04.png" data-orig-height="367" data-orig-width="500"></figure></div>
<p>It shows that almost none of the purchases I've made have been at the full retail price. My actual total cost is $298.11, which for 77 games comes to an average cost/game of $3.87. Now, this number is skewed by factors like expansions (what must a box set include to be considered one game or two or more?) and a few indie titles ($0.49 for The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom), but you can see it's consistent across the chart. Essentially, I've bought award-winning, critically acclaimed games at indie-or-less prices, and I'm not going to complain about that. Steam sales have saved me $800.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this post ties in well with an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/12/low-prices-low-expectations-ars-looks-at-indie-game-pricing.ars">article</a> and discussion on <i>Ars Technica</i> about the correlation between price and expectation in indie games, where the authors point out the hypocrisy of paying $60 for a retail game, making <i>CoD: Black Ops</i> a billion dollar business, and refusing to pay $5 for indie games, whether on Xbox Live or Steam itself. It's a good read and made me question whether the price I pay for a game influences my enjoyment of it or if I am willing to pay more for a game based on the assumption that I will enjoy it. However, these stats seem to show that I am the exception to the premise; I don't pay more than $5 (on average) for either.</p>
